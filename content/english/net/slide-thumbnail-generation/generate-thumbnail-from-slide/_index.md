## Generate Thumbnail from Slide

### Step 2: Open the Presentation

Use the `Presentation` class to open your PowerPoint presentation. Ensure you have the correct file path.

```csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir + "ThumbnailFromSlide.pptx"))
{
    // Access the first slide
    ISlide sld = pres.Slides[0];

    // Create a full-scale image
    Bitmap bmp = sld.GetThumbnail(1f, 1f);

    // Save the image to disk in JPEG format
    bmp.Save(dataDir + "Thumbnail_out.jpg", System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Jpeg);

Here's a brief explanation of what each step does:

1. You open your PowerPoint presentation using the `Presentation` class.
2. You access the first slide using the `ISlide` interface.
