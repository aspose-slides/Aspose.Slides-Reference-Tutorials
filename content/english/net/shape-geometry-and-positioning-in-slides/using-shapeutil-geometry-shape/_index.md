When it comes to creating visually engaging and informative presentations, Aspose.Slides is a powerful tool that provides developers with the capability to manipulate various aspects of presentations programmatically. One essential aspect of presentations is the use of shapes, which play a crucial role in conveying information effectively. In this tutorial, we will delve into the usage of ShapeUtil for handling geometry shapes in presentation slides using Aspose.Slides for .NET. By the end of this guide, you'll have a solid understanding of how to work with geometry shapes and enhance your presentations with ease.

## Introduction to Aspose.Slides and ShapeUtil

Aspose.Slides is a powerful .NET library that empowers developers to create, edit, and manipulate PowerPoint presentations programmatically. ShapeUtil is a part of the Aspose.Slides library that provides a set of utilities for working specifically with shapes within presentations.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

Before we begin, ensure you have the Aspose.Slides library installed in your .NET project. You can use NuGet to easily add the library to your project.

```csharp
// Install Aspose.Slides via NuGet
Install-Package Aspose.Slides
```

## Creating a New Presentation

Let's start by creating a new presentation and adding slides to it.

```csharp
// Create a new presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation();
ISlide slide = presentation.Slides.AddEmptySlide();
```

## Adding Geometry Shapes to Slides

To add geometry shapes to slides, you can use the ShapeUtil class.

```csharp
// Add a rectangle shape to the slide
IShape rectangle = ShapeUtil.AddRectangle(slide, 100, 100, 200, 150);
```

## Modifying Geometry Shapes Properties

You can modify various properties of geometry shapes, such as position, size, and rotation.

```csharp
// Modify the position of the rectangle
rectangle.X = 300;
rectangle.Y = 200;

// Resize the rectangle
rectangle.Width = 250;
rectangle.Height = 100;

// Rotate the rectangle
rectangle.Rotation = 45;
```

## Arranging and Aligning Geometry Shapes

ShapeUtil also provides methods for arranging and aligning shapes on slides.

```csharp
// Arrange shapes horizontally
ShapeUtil.ArrangeHorizontally(slide.Shapes);

// Align shapes to the center
ShapeUtil.AlignToCenter(slide.Shapes);
```

## Grouping and Ungrouping Shapes

You can group multiple shapes together using ShapeUtil.

```csharp
// Group shapes
IShape[] shapesToGroup = new IShape[] { shape1, shape2, shape3 };
IShape groupedShape = ShapeUtil.GroupShapes(slide, shapesToGroup);

// Ungroup shapes
ShapeUtil.UngroupShape(slide, groupedShape);
```

## Applying Formatting to Geometry Shapes

ShapeUtil allows you to apply formatting to shapes, including fill and line styles.

```csharp
// Apply fill color
ShapeUtil.ApplyFillColor(shape, Color.Blue);

// Apply line color and style
ShapeUtil.ApplyLineColor(shape, Color.Black, LineStyle.Single);
```

## Adding Text to Geometry Shapes

You can add text to geometry shapes using ShapeUtil as well.

```csharp
// Add text to shape
ShapeUtil.AddTextToShape(shape, "Hello, Aspose.Slides!", new Font("Arial", 12), Color.Black);
```

## Working with Hyperlinks in Shapes

ShapeUtil enables you to add hyperlinks to shapes.

```csharp
// Add hyperlink to shape
string url = "https://www.example.com";
ShapeUtil.AddHyperlinkToShape(shape, url);
```

## Managing Z-Order of Shapes

ShapeUtil provides methods to manage the z-order of shapes.

```csharp
// Bring shape to front
ShapeUtil.BringToFront(shape);

// Send shape to back
ShapeUtil.SendToBack(shape);
```

## Saving and Exporting the Presentation

Once you've made all the necessary changes, you can save and export the presentation.

```csharp
// Save the presentation
presentation.Save("Presentation.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored the capabilities of Aspose.Slides and ShapeUtil for working with geometry shapes in presentation slides using .NET. We covered the process of creating a new presentation, adding geometry shapes, modifying their properties, applying formatting, adding text, managing hyperlinks, and more. By leveraging the features of Aspose.Slides and ShapeUtil, you can enhance the visual appeal and effectiveness of your presentations.
