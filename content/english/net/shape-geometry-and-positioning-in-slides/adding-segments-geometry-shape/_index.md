4. Modify Segments: Customize each segment's appearance, color, and size.

5. Reassemble Shape: Arrange the segments to form the desired design.

## Source Code Example:

```csharp
// Load the presentation
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation("sample.pptx"))
{
    // Access the shape
    IAutoShape shape = pres.Slides[0].Shapes[0] as IAutoShape;

    // Divide the shape into segments
    // Modify segment properties
    // Reassemble the segments
}
```
