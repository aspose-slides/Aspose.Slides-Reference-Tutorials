## Formatting Rectangle Shapes Step by Step

### 1. Adding a Rectangle Shape

To begin, let's add a rectangle shape to a slide:

```csharp
ISlide slide = pres.Slides[0]; // Select the slide
IRectangleShape rectangle = slide.Shapes.AddRectangle(100, 100, 200, 150); // Add a rectangle
```

### 2. Applying Fill and Border

You can enhance the appearance of the rectangle by applying fill and border properties:

```csharp
rectangle.FillFormat.SolidFillColor.Color = Color.Blue; // Set fill color
rectangle.LineFormat.FillFormat.SolidFillColor.Color = Color.Black; // Set border color
rectangle.LineFormat.Width = 2; // Set border width
```

### 3. Adding Text

Adding text to the rectangle is a great way to convey your message:

```csharp
ITextFrame textFrame = rectangle.TextFrame;
textFrame.Text = "Hello, Aspose!";
textFrame.Paragraphs[0].Portions[0].PortionFormat.FontHeight = 20; // Set font size
```

### 4. Positioning and Alignment

Precise positioning and alignment ensure a polished look:

```csharp
rectangle.X = 300; // Set X coordinate
rectangle.Y = 200; // Set Y coordinate
rectangle.TextFrame.Paragraphs[0].Alignment = TextAlignment.Center; // Align text
```

### 5. Adding Hyperlinks

You can make your rectangle shape interactive by adding hyperlinks:

```csharp
string url = "https://www.aspose.com";
portion.HyperlinkClick = new HyperlinkClick(new Uri(url));
```

By following these steps, you can create visually appealing rectangle shapes in your presentations using Aspose.Slides.
