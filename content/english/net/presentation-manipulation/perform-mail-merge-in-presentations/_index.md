## Step-by-Step Guide on Perform Mail Merge in Presentations

### Prerequisites
Before we dive into the mail merge process, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Visual Studio or any .NET IDE installed
- Aspose.Slides for .NET library (download from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/net/))

### Step 1: Create a New .NET Project
Begin by creating a new .NET project in your preferred IDE. Set up the project with the necessary configurations.

### Step 2: Add Reference to Aspose.Slides
In your project, add a reference to the Aspose.Slides library that you downloaded earlier. This will enable you to utilize its features for mail merge.

### Step 3: Load the Presentation
Load the presentation file that you want to perform the mail merge on. Use the following code snippet to achieve this:

```csharp
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("your-presentation.pptx");
```

### Step 4: Prepare Data Source
Prepare the data source for mail merge. It could be a database, an Excel sheet, or any other data structure containing the required information.

### Step 5: Perform Mail Merge
Now comes the exciting part - performing the actual mail merge. Iterate through the slides and shapes in your presentation, replacing placeholders with data from your data source. Here's a simplified code snippet:

```csharp
foreach (var slide in presentation.Slides)
{
    foreach (var shape in slide.Shapes)
    {
        if (shape is ITextFrame)
        {
            ITextFrame textFrame = (ITextFrame)shape;
            string placeholder = textFrame.Text;
            // Replace placeholder with corresponding data from the data source
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 6: Save the Merged Presentation
Once you've completed the mail merge, save the modified presentation to a new file. This ensures that your original template remains intact.

```csharp
presentation.Save("merged-presentation.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
