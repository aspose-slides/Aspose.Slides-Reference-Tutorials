## Introduction
In the dynamic world of presentations, adding visual appeal to your slides can significantly enhance your message's impact. Aspose.Slides for .NET provides a powerful toolkit to manipulate and beautify your presentation slides programmatically. One such intriguing feature is the ability to apply bevel effects to shapes, adding depth and dimension to your visuals.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Aspose.Slides for .NET: Make sure you have the Aspose.Slides library installed. You can download it from the [official website](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/net/).
- Development Environment: Set up your .NET development environment, and have a basic understanding of C#.
- Document Directory: Create a directory for your documents where the generated presentation files will be saved.
## Import Namespaces
In your C# code, include the necessary namespaces to access the Aspose.Slides functionalities.
```csharp
using System.Drawing;
using Aspose.Slides.Export;
using Aspose.Slides;
```
## Step 1: Set up Your Document Directory
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
bool IsExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir);
if (!IsExists)
    System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);
```
Ensure that the document directory exists, creating it if it's not already present.
## Step 2: Create a Presentation Instance
```csharp
Presentation pres = new Presentation();
ISlide slide = pres.Slides[0];
```
Initialize a presentation instance and add a slide to work with.
## Step 3: Add a Shape to the Slide
```csharp
IAutoShape shape = slide.Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.Ellipse, 30, 30, 100, 100);
shape.FillFormat.FillType = FillType.Solid;
shape.FillFormat.SolidFillColor.Color = Color.Green;
ILineFillFormat format = shape.LineFormat.FillFormat;
format.FillType = FillType.Solid;
format.SolidFillColor.Color = Color.Orange;
shape.LineFormat.Width = 2.0;
```
Create an auto shape (ellipse in this example) and customize its fill and line properties.
## Step 4: Set ThreeDFormat Properties
```csharp
shape.ThreeDFormat.Depth = 4;
shape.ThreeDFormat.BevelTop.BevelType = BevelPresetType.Circle;
shape.ThreeDFormat.BevelTop.Height = 6;
shape.ThreeDFormat.BevelTop.Width = 6;
shape.ThreeDFormat.Camera.CameraType = CameraPresetType.OrthographicFront;
shape.ThreeDFormat.LightRig.LightType = LightRigPresetType.ThreePt;
shape.ThreeDFormat.LightRig.Direction = LightingDirection.Top;
```
Specify the three-dimensional properties, including bevel type, height, width, camera type, light type, and direction.
## Step 5: Save the Presentation
```csharp
pres.Save(dataDir + "Bevel_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
Save the presentation with the applied bevel effects to a PPTX file.
## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully applied bevel effects to a shape in your presentation using Aspose.Slides for .NET. Experiment with different parameters to unleash the full potential of visual enhancements in your slides.
