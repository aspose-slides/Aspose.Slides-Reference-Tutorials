In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk you through the step-by-step process of adding OLE object frames to your presentation slides using Aspose.Slides for .NET.

### Creating a New Presentation

Let's start by creating a new presentation where we'll add our OLE object frame.

```csharp

ISlide slide = presentation.Slides.AddEmptySlide();

// Add content to the slide
ITextFrame textFrame = slide.Shapes.AddTextFrame();
textFrame.Text = "Adding OLE Object Frame";

// Save the presentation
presentation.Save("PresentationWithOLE.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

### Adding OLE Object Frame

Now comes the exciting part â€“ integrating an OLE object frame into your slide. For this example, let's embed an Excel spreadsheet.

```csharp
// Load the presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("PresentationWithOLE.pptx");

// Add an OLE object frame
IOleObjectFrame oleObjectFrame = slide.Shapes.AddOleObjectFrame(x, y, width, height, "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet", stream);

// Save the updated presentation
presentation.Save("PresentationWithOLEUpdated.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
