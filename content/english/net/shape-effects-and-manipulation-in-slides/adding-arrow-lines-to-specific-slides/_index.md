### Creating a New Presentation

### Adding Arrow Shaped Lines

3. To add arrow-shaped lines, you'll need to create LineShape objects with arrow heads.
```csharp
// Create a LineShape with an arrow head
ILineShape arrowLine = slide1.Shapes.AddLine(100, 100, 300, 300);
arrowLine.LineFormat.EndArrowheadLength = LineArrowheadLength.Short;
arrowLine.LineFormat.EndArrowheadStyle = LineArrowheadStyle.Triangle;
```

4. Customize the appearance of the arrow line by adjusting its color, thickness, and other properties.
```csharp
// Customize line properties
arrowLine.LineFormat.LineWidth = 3;
arrowLine.LineFormat.FillFormat.SolidFillColor.Color = Color.Blue;
```

5. Position and angle the arrow line according to your slide's context.
```csharp
// Position and angle the arrow line
arrowLine.X = 200;
arrowLine.Y = 200;
arrowLine.RotationAngle = 45;
```

6. Repeat the process to add arrow-shaped lines to other slides as needed.

### Saving and Sharing Your Enhanced Presentation

7. Once you've added arrow-shaped lines to all desired slides, save your presentation.
```csharp
// Save the presentation
