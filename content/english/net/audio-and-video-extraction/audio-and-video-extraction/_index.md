## Introduction to Aspose.Slides

Aspose.Slides is a powerful .NET library that provides comprehensive functionality for creating, manipulating, and converting PowerPoint presentations. In addition to creating and editing slides, it also offers features for extracting various media elements, including audio and video, from slides.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the implementation, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Visual Studio installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Slides for .NET library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/net).

## Loading Presentation

The first step is to load the PowerPoint presentation using Aspose.Slides. Here's the code snippet to achieve that:

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;

// Load the presentation
using var presentation = new Presentation("your-presentation.pptx");
```

## Extracting Audio from Slides

To extract audio from slides, iterate through each slide and retrieve the audio objects:

```csharp
foreach (var slide in presentation.Slides)
{
    foreach (var shape in slide.Shapes)
    {
        if (shape is IAudioFrame audioFrame)
        {
            // Extract audio from the audio frame
            byte[] audioData = audioFrame.EmbeddedAudio.BinaryData;
            // Process the audio data as needed
        }
    }
}
```

## Extracting Video from Slides

Similarly, to extract video from slides, loop through the slides and identify video shapes:

```csharp
foreach (var slide in presentation.Slides)
{
    foreach (var shape in slide.Shapes)
    {
        if (shape is IVideoFrame videoFrame)
        {
            // Extract video from the video frame
            byte[] videoData = videoFrame.EmbeddedVideo.BinaryData;
            // Process the video data as needed
        }
    }
}
```

## Combining Audio and Video Extraction

You can easily combine the above steps to extract both audio and video from the presentation slides.

## Saving Extracted Media

Once you've extracted audio and video content, you can save them to separate files:

```csharp
File.WriteAllBytes("extracted-audio.mp3", audioData);
File.WriteAllBytes("extracted-video.mp4", videoData);
```

## Handling Errors

It's important to handle potential errors that may occur during the extraction process. Utilize try-catch blocks to gracefully manage exceptions.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we've explored how to extract audio and video content from slides using Aspose.Slides for .NET. By following the outlined steps and using the provided source code examples, you can seamlessly integrate this functionality into your applications. Enhance your PowerPoint processing capabilities with Aspose.Slides and deliver a more engaging user experience.
