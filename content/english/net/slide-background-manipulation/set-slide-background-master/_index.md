using Aspose.Slides;
using System;

namespace SlideBackgroundTutorial
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Initialize the presentation
            Presentation presentation = new Presentation();
            
            // Your code for slide background manipulation goes here
            
            // Save the modified presentation
            presentation.Save("output.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Access Slide Background Master

In order to modify the slide background master, you'll need to access it first. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
// Access the slide background master
ISlideMaster slideMaster = presentation.Masters.SlideMaster;
```

### 3. Set Background Color or Image

Now, let's set the background color or image for the slide master:

#### Set Background Color:
```csharp
// Set background color
slideMaster.Background.Type = BackgroundType.OwnBackground;
slideMaster.Background.FillFormat.SolidFillColor.Color = Color.LightBlue;
```

#### Set Background Image:
```csharp
// Set background image
string imagePath = "background.jpg";
slideMaster.Background.Type = BackgroundType.OwnBackground;
slideMaster.Background.FillFormat.FillType = FillType.Picture;
slideMaster.Background.FillFormat.PictureFillFormat.PictureFillMode = PictureFillMode.Stretch;
slideMaster.Background.FillFormat.PictureFillFormat.Picture.Image = new IPPImage(Image.FromFile(imagePath));
```

### 4. Apply Changes

After setting the desired background, make sure to apply the changes to all slides using the master:

```csharp
// Apply changes to all slides
foreach (ISlide slide in presentation.Slides)
{
    slide.MasterSlide = slideMaster;
}
```

### 5. Save the Presentation

Finally, save the modified presentation:
