## Getting Started: Using Aspose.Slides for .NET

To begin, make sure you have the library installed in your project.

Once you've integrated Aspose.Slides into your project, you're ready to dive into the process of changing the normal slide background. The following sections will guide you through the steps, complete with source code examples.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Changing Slide Background using Aspose.Slides

### 1. Load the Presentation

Before making any changes, you need to load the PowerPoint presentation you wish to modify. Use the following code snippet to load a presentation:

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;

// Load the presentation
using var presentation = new Presentation("path_to_your_presentation.pptx");
```

### 2. Access Slide Background

Each slide in a presentation has a background that can be accessed and modified. To change the background of a specific slide, you need to access the slide's background property. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
// Access the first slide in the presentation
var slide = presentation.Slides[0];

// Access the slide's background
var background = slide.Background;
```

### 3. Set Background Image

To set an image as the slide's background, you can use the following code:

```csharp
// Load the image
using var backgroundImage = new Bitmap("path_to_your_background_image.jpg");

// Set the image as the slide's background
background.Type = BackgroundType.OwnBackground;
background.FillFormat.FillType = FillType.Picture;
background.FillFormat.PictureFillFormat.Picture.Image = presentation.Images.AddImage(backgroundImage);
```

### 4. Set Background Color

If you prefer a solid color background, you can set it using the following code:

```csharp
// Set the background color
background.FillFormat.FillType = FillType.Solid;
background.FillFormat.SolidFillColor.Color = Color.LightBlue;
```

### 5. Save the Presentation

Once you've made the desired changes to the slide background, don't forget to save the presentation:

```csharp
// Save the modified presentation
presentation.Save("path_to_save_modified_presentation.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
