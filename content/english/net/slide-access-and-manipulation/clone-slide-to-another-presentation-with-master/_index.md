## Introduction to Copy Slide to New Presentation with Master Slide

When it comes to creating and manipulating PowerPoint presentations programmatically, Aspose.Slides for .NET provides a powerful and versatile solution. In this step-by-step guide, we will walk you through the process of copying a slide from one presentation to another while preserving the master slide. We'll cover all the necessary code snippets and explanations to help you achieve this task seamlessly.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Visual Studio or any other preferred integrated development environment (IDE)
- .NET Framework installed
- Aspose.Slides for .NET library (download from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/net/)

## Step 1: Create a New Presentation

Open your Visual Studio and create a new project. Add a reference to the Aspose.Slides library.

## Step 2: Load Source and Destination Presentations

Load the source and destination presentations using the `Presentation` class:

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;

// Load source presentation
var sourcePresentation = new Presentation("source.pptx");

// Load destination presentation
var destPresentation = new Presentation("destination.pptx");
```

## Step 3: Copy Slide with Master Slide

To copy a slide from the source presentation to the destination presentation while preserving the master slide, use the following code:

```csharp
// Copy the slide from source to destination
var sourceSlide = sourcePresentation.Slides[0];
var copiedSlide = destPresentation.Slides.AddClone(sourceSlide);
```

## Step 4: Save the Destination Presentation

After copying the slide, save the destination presentation:

```csharp
// Save the destination presentation
destPresentation.Save("output.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

## Step 5: Complete Source Code

Here's the complete source code for copying a slide to a new presentation with the master slide:

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;

namespace SlideCopyApp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Load source presentation
            var sourcePresentation = new Presentation("source.pptx");

            // Load destination presentation
            var destPresentation = new Presentation("destination.pptx");

            // Copy the slide from source to destination
            var sourceSlide = sourcePresentation.Slides[0];
            var copiedSlide = destPresentation.Slides.AddClone(sourceSlide);

            // Save the destination presentation
            destPresentation.Save("output.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
        }
    }
}
```
