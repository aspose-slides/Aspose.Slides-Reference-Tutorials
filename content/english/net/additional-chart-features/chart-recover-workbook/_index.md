## Introduction

Accidents can happen, and you might find yourself needing to recover a workbook from a chart. Aspose.Slides for .NET comes to the rescue in such situations. This powerful library allows you to extract data from charts in presentations and convert it into a new workbook. In this step-by-step guide, we will walk you through the process of recovering a workbook from a chart using Aspose.Slides for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following in place:

- Visual Studio: Download and install Visual Studio, which is essential for .NET development.
- Aspose.Slides for .NET: You can download the library from [here](https://downloads.aspose.com/slides/net).

## Step 1: Install Aspose.Slides for .NET

If you haven't already, download and install Aspose.Slides for .NET. This library provides comprehensive features to work with PowerPoint presentations programmatically.

## Step 2: Load the Presentation

To get started, create a new C# project in Visual Studio. Add references to the necessary Aspose.Slides assemblies. Load the PowerPoint presentation that contains the chart you want to recover data from.

```csharp
// Load the presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("your-presentation.pptx");
```

## Step 3: Identify the Chart

Identify the slide and chart from which you want to recover data. You can access slides using the `presentation.Slides` collection and charts using the `slide.Shapes` collection.

```csharp
// Get the slide containing the chart
ISlide slide = presentation.Slides[0];

// Get the chart
IChart chart = null;
foreach (IShape shape in slide.Shapes)
{
    if (shape is IChart)
    {
        chart = (IChart)shape;
        break;
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Extract Data from Chart

Extract the data from the chart using Aspose.Slides' API. You can retrieve values from chart series and categories.

```csharp
// Extract chart data
IChartData chartData = chart.ChartData;
```

## Step 5: Create a New Workbook

Create a new Excel workbook using a library like EPPlus or ClosedXML.

```csharp
// Create a new Excel workbook
using (var excelPackage = new ExcelPackage())
{
    var worksheet = excelPackage.Workbook.Worksheets.Add("Chart Data");
    // Add code here to populate the worksheet headers
}
```

## Step 6: Populate Workbook with Chart Data

Populate the Excel worksheet with the data extracted from the chart.

```csharp
// Populate Excel worksheet with chart data
int rowIndex = 2;
foreach (var series in chartData.Series)
{
    worksheet.Cells[rowIndex, 1].Value = series.Name;
    // Add code here to populate the worksheet with series data
    rowIndex++;
}
```

## Step 7: Save the Workbook

Save the Excel workbook with the recovered chart data.

```csharp
// Save the Excel workbook
excelPackage.SaveAs(new FileInfo("recovered-workbook.xlsx"));
```

## Conclusion

Recovering a workbook from a chart is made easy with Aspose.Slides for .NET. By following these steps, you can programmatically extract data from a chart in a PowerPoint presentation and create a new Excel workbook with the recovered data. This process can be a lifesaver when accidents occur, and data needs to be salvaged.
