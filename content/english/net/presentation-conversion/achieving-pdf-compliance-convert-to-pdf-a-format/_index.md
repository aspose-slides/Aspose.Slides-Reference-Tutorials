## Introduction to PDF/A Compliance

PDF/A is a specialized version of the PDF format that is tailored for digital archiving and long-term preservation of electronic documents. It restricts certain PDF features to ensure that the document's visual appearance remains consistent over time, regardless of software, hardware, or operating systems.

## Why is PDF/A Compliance Important?

As digital documents become more prevalent, ensuring their accessibility and integrity is essential. PDF/A compliance guarantees that documents can be reliably accessed and rendered in the future, even as technology evolves. This is particularly crucial for legal, governmental, and archival purposes.

using var pdfDocument = new Document("output.pdf");

// Apply PDF/A compliance
pdfDocument.Convert(new PdfFormatOptions(PdfImageCompression.Auto));
```
