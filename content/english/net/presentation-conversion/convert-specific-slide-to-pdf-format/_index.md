## Introduction

Aspose.Slides for .NET is a powerful library that allows developers to work with PowerPoint presentations programmatically. One of its key features is the ability to convert slides to various formats, including PDF. In this tutorial, we'll focus on how to use Aspose.Slides for .NET to convert specific slides to PDF format.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, you'll need to have the following set up:

- Visual Studio or any preferred C# development environment.
- Aspose.Slides for .NET library installed.
- A PowerPoint presentation (PPTX format) that you want to convert.
- A destination directory where you want to save the converted PDF.

## Step 1: Setting up Your Project

To get started, create a new C# project in Visual Studio or your preferred development environment. Make sure you've installed the Aspose.Slides for .NET library and added it as a reference to your project.

## Step 2: Writing the Code

string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
string outPath = "Your Output Directory";

using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation(dataDir + "SelectedSlides.pptx"))
{
    // Setting array of slides positions
    int[] slides = { 1, 3 };

    // Save the presentation to PDF
    presentation.Save(outPath + "RequiredSelectedSlides_out.pdf", slides, SaveFormat.Pdf);
}
```

In this code:

- Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the directory path where your PowerPoint presentation file is located.
