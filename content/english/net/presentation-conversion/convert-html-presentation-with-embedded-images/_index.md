## 1. Introduction

Aspose.Slides for .NET provides a convenient way to convert PowerPoint presentations to HTML5 format while preserving embedded images. This can be incredibly useful for displaying your presentations on websites or in web applications.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Visual Studio or any C# development environment.
- Aspose.Slides for .NET library.
- A sample PowerPoint presentation with embedded images.
- Basic knowledge of C# programming.

## 3. Setting Up Your Project

Start by creating a new C# project in your preferred development environment. Ensure that you have the Aspose.Slides for .NET library properly referenced in your project.

## 4. Loading the Source Presentation

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
string presentationName = Path.Combine(dataDir, "PresentationDemo.pptx");

using (Presentation pres = new Presentation(presentationName))
{
    // Your code for processing the presentation goes here
}
```

## 5. Configuring HTML Conversion Options

To configure HTML conversion options, you can use the `Html5Options` class. Here's an example of how to set some options:

```csharp
Html5Options options = new Html5Options()
{
    EmbedImages = false, // Do not save images in HTML5 document
    OutputPath = "Your Output Directory" // Set the path for external images
};
```

## 6. Creating the Output Directory

Before saving the presentation in HTML5 format, it's a good practice to create the output directory if it doesn't already exist:

```csharp
string outFilePath = Path.Combine(outPath, "HTMLConversion");

if (!Directory.Exists(outFilePath))
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(outFilePath);
}
```

## 7. Saving the Presentation in HTML5 Format

Now, let's save the presentation in HTML5 format:

```csharp
pres.Save(Path.Combine(outFilePath, "pres.html"), SaveFormat.Html5, options);
```
