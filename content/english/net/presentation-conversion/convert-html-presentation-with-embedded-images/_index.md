## Introduction to Convert HTML Presentation with Embedded Images 

In this guide, we will walk through the process of converting an HTML presentation with embedded images to PowerPoint presentation (PPTX) format using Aspose.Slides for .NET. Aspose.Slides is a powerful library that allows you to work with PowerPoint presentations programmatically. 

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following in place:
- Visual Studio or any other .NET development environment installed.
- Aspose.Slides for .NET library. You can download it from [here](https://downloads.aspose.com/slides/net).
- Basic knowledge of C# and .NET development.

## Steps

1. Create a new C# project:
   Open your Visual Studio and create a new C# project.

2. Install Aspose.Slides for .NET:
   Install the Aspose.Slides for .NET library in your project using NuGet Package Manager or by adding a reference to the downloaded DLL.

3. Include necessary namespaces:
   In your code file, include the necessary namespaces:
   ```csharp
   using Aspose.Slides;
   using Aspose.Slides.Export;
   using System.IO;
   ```

4. Load HTML content:
   Load the HTML content of the presentation into a string. You can retrieve the HTML from a file or a web source.
   ```csharp

   ```

5. Create a new presentation:
   Create a new instance of the `Presentation` class.
   ```csharp
   using Presentation presentation = new Presentation();
   ```

6. Add slides with HTML content:
   Add slides to the presentation and set the HTML content for each slide.
   ```csharp
   ISlideCollection slides = presentation.Slides;

   // Create a slide
   ISlide slide = slides.AddEmptySlide();

   // Add HTML content to the slide
   IAutoShape textShape = slide.Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, 50, 50, 600, 400);
   textShape.TextFrame.Text = htmlContent;
   ```

7. Save the presentation:
   Save the presentation in PPTX format.
   ```csharp
   presentation.Save("output_presentation.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
   ```

8. Run the application:
   Build and run your application. It will convert the HTML presentation with embedded images to a PowerPoint presentation.

namespace HTMLToPPTConversion
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Load HTML content from file
            string htmlContent = File.ReadAllText("path_to_your_html_file.html");

            // Create a new presentation
            using Presentation presentation = new Presentation();

            // Add a slide with HTML content
            ISlide slide = presentation.Slides.AddEmptySlide();
            IAutoShape textShape = slide.Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, 50, 50, 600, 400);
            textShape.TextFrame.Text = htmlContent;

            // Save the presentation in PPTX format
            presentation.Save("output_presentation.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
        }
