Now, let's move on to the most crucial part: converting slides along with their notes into a PDF document. Aspose.Slides for .NET simplifies this process.

## Code Implementation

Below is a simplified example of how you can convert slides to PDF with notes using Aspose.Slides for .NET:

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Load the presentation
        using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation("your-presentation.pptx"))
        {
            // Iterate through each slide
            foreach (ISlide slide in presentation.Slides)
            {
                // Access slide notes
                string slideNotes = slide.NotesText;

                // Convert slide and notes to PDF
                // Code for PDF conversion
