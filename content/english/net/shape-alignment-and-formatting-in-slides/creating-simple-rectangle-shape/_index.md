## Import Namespaces
In your C# project, start by importing the necessary namespaces to access Aspose.Slides functionalities:
```csharp

using Aspose.Slides;
using Aspose.Slides.Export;
```
## Step 1: Set Up the Project
Begin by creating a new C# project in Visual Studio. Ensure that Aspose.Slides for .NET is correctly referenced in your project.
## Step 2: Initialize Presentation Object
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
bool IsExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir);
if (!IsExists)
    System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
    // Your code for the next steps will go here.
}
```
## Step 3: Get the First Slide
```csharp
ISlide sld = pres.Slides[0];
```
## Step 4: Add Rectangle AutoShape
```csharp
sld.Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, 50, 150, 150, 50);
```
This code adds a rectangle shape at coordinates (50, 150) with a width of 150 and a height of 50.
## Step 5: Save the Presentation
