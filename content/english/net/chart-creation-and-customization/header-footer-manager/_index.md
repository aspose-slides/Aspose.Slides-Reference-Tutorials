## Adding Headers and Footers

## Slide Number

Adding a slide number to your slides is an effective way to help your audience keep track of their progress. With Aspose.Slides, this can be achieved with just a few lines of code:

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;

// Load the presentation
using Presentation presentation = new Presentation("your-presentation.pptx");

// Enable slide numbers
foreach (ISlide slide in presentation.Slides)
{
    slide.HeadersFooters.SlideNumberVisibility = true;
}

// Save the modified presentation
presentation.Save("modified-presentation.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

## Date and Time

Including the presentation's creation date and time can provide additional context. Here's how you can add the date and time to your slides:

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;

// Load the presentation
using Presentation presentation = new Presentation("your-presentation.pptx");

// Enable date and time
foreach (ISlide slide in presentation.Slides)
{
    slide.HeadersFooters.DateAndTimeVisibility = true;
}

// Save the modified presentation
presentation.Save("modified-presentation.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

## Custom Text

Sometimes, you might want to include custom text in the header or footer. This could be your company's name, event details, or any other relevant information:

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;

// Load the presentation
using Presentation presentation = new Presentation("your-presentation.pptx");

// Set custom header and footer text
foreach (ISlide slide in presentation.Slides)
{
    slide.HeadersFooters.HeaderText = "Your Custom Header Text";
    slide.HeadersFooters.FooterText = "Your Custom Footer Text";
}

// Save the modified presentation
presentation.Save("modified-presentation.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

## Font and Color

Aspose.Slides allows you to customize the font and color of your headers and footers to match your presentation's design:

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;

// Load the presentation
using Presentation presentation = new Presentation("your-presentation.pptx");

// Customize font and color
foreach (ISlide slide in presentation.Slides)
{
    slide.HeadersFooters.TextFormat.PortionFormat.FontHeight = 18;
    slide.HeadersFooters.TextFormat.PortionFormat.FillFormat.SolidFillColor.Color = Color.Black;
}

// Save the modified presentation
presentation.Save("modified-presentation.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

## Alignment and Position

Controlling the alignment and position of headers and footers ensures a consistent look across your slides:

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;

// Load the presentation
using Presentation presentation = new Presentation("your-presentation.pptx");

// Align headers and footers
foreach (ISlide slide in presentation.Slides)
{
    slide.HeadersFooters.TextFormat.Alignment = TextAlignment.Center;
    slide.HeadersFooters.TextFormat.Position = HeaderFooterPosition.Bottom;
}

// Save the modified presentation
presentation.Save("modified-presentation.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

## Handling Different Slide Layouts

Different slides may have distinct layouts, such as title slides or content slides. Aspose.Slides allows you to tailor headers and footers for specific slide layouts:

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;

// Load the presentation
using Presentation presentation = new Presentation("your-presentation.pptx");

// Customize headers and footers for specific slide layouts
foreach (ISlide slide in presentation.Slides)
{
    if (slide.LayoutSlide is TitleSlideLayout)
    {
        slide.HeadersFooters.HeaderText = "Title Slide Header";
    }
    else
    {
        slide.HeadersFooters.FooterText = "Content Slide Footer";
    }
}

// Save the modified presentation
presentation.Save("modified-presentation.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

## Slide Specific Headers and Footers

In some cases, you might need different headers and footers for individual slides. Aspose.Slides makes this possible:

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;

// Load the presentation
using Presentation presentation = new Presentation("your-presentation.pptx");

// Set slide-specific headers and footers
foreach (ISlide slide in presentation.Slides)
{
    if (slide.SlideNumber == 3)
    {
        slide.HeadersFooters.HeaderText = "Special Header for Slide 3";
    }
    else
    {
        slide.HeadersFooters.FooterText = "Common Footer Text";
    }
}

// Save the modified presentation
presentation.Save("modified-presentation.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

## Master Slides

Master slides provide a consistent template for your presentation. You can apply headers and footers to master slides to ensure uniformity:

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;



// Load the presentation
using Presentation presentation = new Presentation("your-presentation.pptx");

// Access the master slide
IMasterSlide masterSlide = presentation.Masters[0];

// Set headers and footers on the master slide
masterSlide.HeadersFooters.HeaderText = "Master Slide Header";
masterSlide.HeadersFooters.FooterText = "Master Slide Footer";

// Save the modified presentation
presentation.Save("modified-presentation.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

## Exporting and Sharing

Once you have customized your headers and footers, it's time to share your presentation with others. You can easily export it to various formats using Aspose.Slides:

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;

// Load the presentation
using Presentation presentation = new Presentation("your-presentation.pptx");

// Save the presentation in different formats
presentation.Save("presentation.pdf", SaveFormat.Pdf);
presentation.Save("presentation.png", SaveFormat.Png);
```
