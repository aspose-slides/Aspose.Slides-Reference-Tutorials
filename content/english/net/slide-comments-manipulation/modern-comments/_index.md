   To initiate the comments management process, start by adding comments to specific slides. Utilize the Aspose.Slides API to programmatically insert comments, providing context and guidance for reviewers.

   ```csharp

   comment.CreatedTime = DateTime.Now;
   ```

2. ### Navigating Comments:
   Aspose.Slides allows you to navigate through comments effortlessly. This feature ensures that reviewers and content creators can engage in focused discussions, addressing feedback point by point.

   ```csharp
   // Navigating through comments in a slide using Aspose.Slides API

   foreach (IComment comment in slide.Comments)
   {
       Console.WriteLine($"Comment by {comment.Author}: {comment.Text}");
   }
   ```
