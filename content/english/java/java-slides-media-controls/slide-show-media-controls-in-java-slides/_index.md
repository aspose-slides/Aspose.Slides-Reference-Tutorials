## Introduction to Slide Show Media Controls in Java Slides

In the realm of dynamic and engaging presentations, multimedia elements play a pivotal role in capturing the audience's attention. Java Slides, with the assistance of Aspose.Slides for Java, empowers developers to create captivating slide shows that incorporate media controls seamlessly. Whether you are designing a training module, a sales pitch, or an educational presentation, the ability to control media during the slideshow is a game-changer.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Aspose.Slides for Java library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).
- An integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice, such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before we dive into the code, ensure that you have set up your development environment correctly. Follow these steps:

- Install JDK on your system.
- Download Aspose.Slides for Java from the provided link.
- Set up your preferred IDE.

## Step 2: Creating a New Presentation

Let's start by creating a new presentation. Here's how you can do it in Java Slides:

```java
// Path to PPTX document
String outFilePath = RunExamples.getOutPath() + "SlideShowMediaControl.pptx";
Presentation pres = new Presentation();
```

In this code snippet, we create a new presentation object and specify the path where the presentation will be saved.

## Step 3: Enabling Media Controls

To enable media control display in slideshow mode, use the following code:

```java
pres.getSlideShowSettings().setShowMediaControls(true);
```

This line of code instructs Java Slides to display media controls during the slideshow.

## Step 4: Adding Media to Slides

Now, let's add media to our slides. You can add audio or video files to slides using Java Slides' extensive features.

Customize Media Playback
You can further customize media playback, such as setting the start and end time, volume, and more, to create a tailored multimedia experience for your audience.

## Step 5: Saving the Presentation

Once you have added media and customized their playback, save the presentation in PPTX format using the following code:

```java
pres.save(outFilePath, SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

This code saves your presentation with media controls enabled.
