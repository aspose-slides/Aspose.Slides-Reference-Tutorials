## Introduction to Checking Presentation Protection in Java Slides

In this tutorial, we will explore how to check presentation protection using Aspose.Slides for Java. We'll cover two scenarios: checking write protection and checking open protection for a presentation. We'll provide step-by-step code examples for each scenario.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the Aspose.Slides for Java library set up in your Java project. You can download it from the Aspose website and add it to your project's dependencies.

### Maven Dependency

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-slides</artifactId>
    <version>your_version_here</version>
</dependency>
```

Replace `your_version_here` with the version of Aspose.Slides for Java you are using.

## Step 1: Check Write Protection

To check if a presentation is write-protected by a password, you can use the `IPresentationInfo` interface. Here's the code to do that:

```java
// Path for the source presentation
String pptxFile = "path_to_presentation.pptx";

// Check the Write Protection Password via IPresentationInfo Interface
IPresentationInfo presentationInfo = PresentationFactory.getInstance().getPresentationInfo(pptxFile);
boolean isWriteProtectedByPassword = presentationInfo.isWriteProtected() == NullableBool.True
        && presentationInfo.checkWriteProtection("password_here");

System.out.println("Is presentation write protected by password = " + isWriteProtectedByPassword);
```

Replace `"path_to_presentation.pptx"` with the actual path to your presentation file and `"password_here"` with the write protection password.

## Step 2: Check Open Protection

To check if a presentation is protected by a password for opening, you can use the `IPresentationInfo` interface. Here's the code to do that:

```java
// Path for the source presentation
String pptFile = "path_to_presentation.ppt";

// Check Presentation Open Protection via IPresentationInfo Interface
presentationInfo = PresentationFactory.getInstance().getPresentationInfo(pptFile);
if (presentationInfo.isPasswordProtected()) {
    System.out.println("The presentation is protected by password to open.");
}
```

Replace `"path_to_presentation.ppt"` with the actual path to your presentation file.

## Complete Source Code For Check Presentation Protection in Java Slides

```java
//Path for source presentation
String pptxFile = RunExamples.getDataDir_PresentationProperties() + "modify_pass2.pptx";
String pptFile = RunExamples.getDataDir_PresentationProperties() + "open_pass1.ppt";
// Check the Write Protection Password via IPresentationInfo Interface
IPresentationInfo presentationInfo = PresentationFactory.getInstance().getPresentationInfo(pptxFile);
boolean isWriteProtectedByPassword = presentationInfo.isWriteProtected() == NullableBool.True && presentationInfo.checkWriteProtection("pass2");
System.out.println("Is presentation write protected by password = " + isWriteProtectedByPassword);
// Check the Write Protection Password via IProtectionManager Interface
Presentation presentation = new Presentation();
try
{
	boolean isWriteProtected = presentation.getProtectionManager().checkWriteProtection("pass2");
	System.out.println("Is presentation write protected = " + isWriteProtected);
}
finally
{
	if (presentation != null) presentation.dispose();
}
// Check Presentation Open Protection via IPresentationInfo Interface
presentationInfo = PresentationFactory.getInstance().getPresentationInfo(pptFile);
if (presentationInfo.isPasswordProtected())
{
	System.out.println("The presentation '" + pptxFile + "' is protected by password to open.");
}
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to check presentation protection in Java slides using Aspose.Slides for Java. We covered two scenarios: checking write protection and checking open protection. You can now integrate these checks into your Java applications to handle protected presentations effectively.
