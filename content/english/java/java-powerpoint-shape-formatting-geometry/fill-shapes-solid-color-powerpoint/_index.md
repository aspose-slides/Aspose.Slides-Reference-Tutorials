## Introduction
If you've ever worked with PowerPoint presentations, you know that adding shapes and customizing their colors can be a crucial aspect of making your slides visually appealing and informative. With Aspose.Slides for Java, this process becomes a breeze. Whether you're a developer looking to automate the creation of PowerPoint presentations or someone interested in adding a splash of color to your slides, this tutorial will guide you through the process of filling shapes with solid colors using Aspose.Slides for Java.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the code, there are a few prerequisites you need to have in place:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure that you have JDK installed on your system. You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
2. Aspose.Slides for Java: Download the Aspose.Slides for Java library from the [Aspose website](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).
3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse will make your development process smoother.
4. Basic Knowledge of Java: Familiarity with Java programming will help you understand and implement the code effectively.

## Import Packages
To start using Aspose.Slides for Java, you need to import the necessary packages. Here's how you can do it:
```java
import com.aspose.slides.*;
import com.aspose.slides.examples.RunExamples;
import java.awt.*;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Your Project
First, you need to set up your Java project and include Aspose.Slides for Java in your project dependencies. If you're using Maven, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-slides</artifactId>
    <version>XX.X</version> <!-- Replace XX.X with the latest version -->
</dependency>
```
If you're not using Maven, download the JAR file from the [Aspose website](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/) and add it to your project's build path.
## Step 2: Initialize the Presentation
Create an instance of the `Presentation` class. This class represents the PowerPoint presentation you will be working with.
```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Create an instance of Presentation class
Presentation presentation = new Presentation();
```
## Step 3: Access the First Slide
Next, you need to get the first slide of the presentation where you will add your shapes.
```java
// Get the first slide
ISlide slide = presentation.getSlides().get_Item(0);
```
## Step 4: Add a Shape to the Slide
Now, let's add a rectangle shape to the slide. You can customize the position and size of the shape by adjusting the parameters.
```java
// Add autoshape of rectangle type
IShape shape = slide.getShapes().addAutoShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, 50, 150, 75, 150);
```
## Step 5: Set the Fill Type to Solid
To fill the shape with a solid color, set the fill type to `Solid`.
```java
// Set the fill type to Solid
shape.getFillFormat().setFillType(FillType.Solid);
```
## Step 6: Choose and Apply the Color
Choose a color for the shape. Here, we're using yellow, but you can select any color you like.
```java
// Set the color of the rectangle
shape.getFillFormat().getSolidFillColor().setColor(Color.YELLOW);
```
## Step 7: Save the Presentation
Finally, save the modified presentation to a file.
```java
// Write the PPTX file to disk
presentation.save(dataDir + "RectShpSolid_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
