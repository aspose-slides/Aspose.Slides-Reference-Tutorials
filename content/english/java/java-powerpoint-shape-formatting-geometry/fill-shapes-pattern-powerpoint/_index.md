## Introduction
Creating visually appealing presentations is essential for engaging your audience. One way to enhance your PowerPoint slides is by filling shapes with patterns. In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps to fill shapes with patterns using Aspose.Slides for Java. This guide is tailored for developers who want to leverage the powerful features of Aspose.Slides to create stunning presentations programmatically.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the code, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
- Aspose.Slides for Java library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).
- Basic knowledge of Java programming.
## Import Packages
First, let's import the necessary packages required for our example.
```java
import com.aspose.slides.*;

import java.awt.*;
import java.io.File;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Your Project
Before writing the code, ensure your project is set up correctly. Create a new Java project in your IDE and add the Aspose.Slides for Java library to your project dependencies.
## Step 2: Create the Document Directory
To manage your files efficiently, let's create a directory where we will save our PowerPoint presentation.
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Create directory if it is not already present.
boolean isExists = new File(dataDir).exists();
if (!isExists) {
    new File(dataDir).mkdirs();
}
```
This snippet checks if the directory exists and creates it if it doesnâ€™t.
## Step 3: Instantiate the Presentation Class
Next, we need to create an instance of the `Presentation` class, which represents our PowerPoint file.
```java
Presentation pres = new Presentation();
```
This initializes a new presentation object that we will use to add slides and shapes.
## Step 4: Access the First Slide
To begin, we need to access the first slide in our presentation. This is where we will add our shapes.
```java
ISlide slide = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
```
## Step 5: Add a Rectangle Shape
Let's add a rectangular shape to our slide. This rectangle will be filled with a pattern.
```java
IShape shape = slide.getShapes().addAutoShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, 50, 150, 75, 150);
```
This code snippet adds a rectangle to the slide at the specified position and size.
## Step 6: Set the Fill Type to Pattern
Now, we need to set the fill type of our rectangle to a pattern fill.
```java
shape.getFillFormat().setFillType(FillType.Pattern);
```
## Step 7: Choose a Pattern Style
Aspose.Slides provides various pattern styles. In this example, we will use the "Trellis" pattern.
```java
shape.getFillFormat().getPatternFormat().setPatternStyle(PatternStyle.Trellis);
```
## Step 8: Set Pattern Colors
We can customize the colors of our pattern. Let's set the background color to light gray and the foreground color to yellow.
```java
shape.getFillFormat().getPatternFormat().getBackColor().setColor(Color.LIGHT_GRAY);
shape.getFillFormat().getPatternFormat().getForeColor().setColor(Color.YELLOW);
```
## Step 9: Save the Presentation
After setting up our shape with the desired pattern, we need to save the presentation to a file.
```java
pres.save(dataDir + "RectShpPatt_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
This saves the presentation in the specified directory with the filename "RectShpPatt_out.pptx".
## Step 10: Clean Up Resources
It's good practice to dispose of the presentation object to free up resources.
```java
if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
```
## Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully filled a shape with a pattern in a PowerPoint slide using Aspose.Slides for Java. This powerful library allows you to create and manipulate presentations with ease, adding a professional touch to your projects.
