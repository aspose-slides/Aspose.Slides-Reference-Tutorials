## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

## Import Packages
Import the necessary packages into your Java project:
```java
import com.aspose.slides.*;

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Your Project Directory
Ensure you have a directory structure set up for your project. If not, create one to organize your files effectively.
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
boolean isExists = new File(dataDir).exists();
if (!isExists)
    new File(dataDir).mkdirs();
```
## Step 2: Instantiate Presentation Class
Instantiate the `Presentation` class to represent the PowerPoint presentation.
```java
Presentation pres = new Presentation();
```
## Step 3: Get the Slide and Load Audio File
Retrieve the first slide and load the audio file from your directory.
```java
ISlide sld = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
FileInputStream fstr = new FileInputStream(dataDir + "sampleaudio.wav");
```
## Step 4: Add Audio Frame
Add the audio frame to the slide.
```java
IAudioFrame audioFrame = sld.getShapes().addAudioFrameEmbedded(50, 150, 100, 100, fstr);
```
## Step 5: Set Audio Properties
Set properties such as play across slides, rewind audio, play mode, and volume.
```java
audioFrame.setPlayAcrossSlides(true);
audioFrame.setRewindAudio(true);
audioFrame.setPlayMode(AudioPlayModePreset.Auto);
audioFrame.setVolume(AudioVolumeMode.Loud);
```
## Step 6: Save the Presentation
Save the modified presentation with the added audio frame.
```java
pres.save(dataDir + "AudioFrameEmbed_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
