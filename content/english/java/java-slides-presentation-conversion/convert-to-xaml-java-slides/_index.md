## Introduction Convert to XAML in Java Slides

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore how to convert presentations to XAML format using the Aspose.Slides for Java API. XAML (Extensible Application Markup Language) is a widely used markup language for creating user interfaces. Converting presentations to XAML can be a crucial step in integrating your PowerPoint content into various applications, especially those built with technologies like WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation).

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the conversion process, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.Slides for Java API: You should have Aspose.Slides for Java installed and set up in your development environment. If not, you can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).

## Step 1: Loading the Presentation

To begin, we need to load the source PowerPoint presentation that we want to convert to XAML. You can do this by providing the path to your presentation file. Here's a code snippet to get you started:

```java
// Path to source presentation
String presentationFileName = "XamlEtalon.pptx";
Presentation pres = new Presentation(presentationFileName);
```

## Step 2: Configuring Conversion Options

Before converting the presentation, you can configure various conversion options to tailor the output to your needs. In our case, we'll create XAML conversion options and set them up as follows:

```java
// Create conversion options
XamlOptions xamlOptions = new XamlOptions();
xamlOptions.setExportHiddenSlides(true);
```

These options allow us to export hidden slides and customize the conversion process.

## Step 3: Implementing the Output Saver

To save the converted XAML content, we need to define an output saver. Here's a custom implementation of an output saver for XAML:

```java
class NewXamlSaver implements IXamlOutputSaver
{
    private Map<String, String> m_result = new HashMap<String, String>();

    public Map<String, String> getResults()
    {
        return m_result;
    }

    public void save(String path, byte[] data)
    {
        String name = new File(path).getName();
        m_result.put(name, new String(data, StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
    }
}
```

This custom output saver stores the converted XAML data in a map.

## Step 4: Converting and Saving Slides

With the presentation loaded and conversion options set, we can now proceed to convert the slides and save them as XAML files. Here's how you can do it:

```java
try {
    // Define your own output-saving service
    NewXamlSaver newXamlSaver = new NewXamlSaver();
    xamlOptions.setOutputSaver(newXamlSaver);
    
    // Convert slides
    pres.save(xamlOptions);
    
    // Save XAML files to an output directory
    for (Map.Entry<String, String> pair : newXamlSaver.getResults().entrySet()) {
        FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(pair.getKey(), true);
        writer.append(pair.getValue());
        writer.close();
    }
} catch(IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} finally {
    if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
}
```

In this step, we set up the custom output saver, perform the conversion, and save the resulting XAML files.

```java
	// Path to source presentation
	String presentationFileName = RunExamples.getDataDir_Conversion() + "XamlEtalon.pptx";
	Presentation pres = new Presentation(presentationFileName);
	try {
		// Create convertion options
		XamlOptions xamlOptions = new XamlOptions();
		xamlOptions.setExportHiddenSlides(true);
		// Define your own output-saving service
		NewXamlSaver newXamlSaver = new NewXamlSaver();
		xamlOptions.setOutputSaver(newXamlSaver);
		// Convert slides
		pres.save(xamlOptions);
		// Save XAML files to an output directory
		for (Map.Entry<String, String> pair : newXamlSaver.getResults().entrySet()) {
			FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(RunExamples.getOutPath() + pair.getKey(), true);
			writer.append(pair.getValue());
			writer.close();
		}
	} catch(IOException e) {
		e.printStackTrace();
	} finally {
		if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
	}
}

{
	private Map<String, String> m_result =  new HashMap<String, String>();
	public Map<String, String> getResults()
	{
		return m_result;
	}
	public void save(String path, byte[] data)
	{
		String name = new File(path).getName();
		m_result.put(name, new String(data, StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
	}
```
