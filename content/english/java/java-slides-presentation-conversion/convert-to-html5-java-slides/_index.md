## Introduction to Convert PowerPoint Presentation to HTML5 in Java using Aspose.Slides

In this tutorial, we will learn how to convert a PowerPoint presentation to HTML5 format using Aspose.Slides for Java. Aspose.Slides is a powerful library that allows you to work with PowerPoint presentations programmatically.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.Slides for Java Library: You should have the Aspose.Slides for Java library installed in your project. You can download it from the [Aspose website](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/).

2. Java Development Environment: Ensure that you have a Java development environment set up on your system.

## Step 1: Import Aspose.Slides Library

First, you need to import the Aspose.Slides library into your Java project. You can do this by adding the following import statement at the beginning of your Java file:

```java
import com.aspose.slides.Html5Options;
import com.aspose.slides.Presentation;
import com.aspose.slides.SaveFormat;
```

## Step 2: Load the PowerPoint Presentation

Next, you need to load the PowerPoint presentation that you want to convert to HTML5. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` and `"Demo.pptx"` with the actual path to your presentation file:

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
String outFilePath = "path/to/output/Demo.html"; // Specify the path where you want to save the HTML5 output

// Load the PowerPoint presentation
Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir + "Demo.pptx");
```

## Step 3: Configure HTML5 Conversion Options

You can configure various options for the HTML5 conversion using the `Html5Options` class. For example, you can enable or disable shape animations and slide transitions. In this example, we'll enable both animations:

```java
Html5Options options = new Html5Options();
options.setAnimateShapes(true); // Enable shape animations
options.setAnimateTransitions(true); // Enable slide transitions
```

## Step 4: Convert to HTML5

Now, it's time to perform the conversion and save the HTML5 output to the specified file:

```java
try {
    // Save the presentation as HTML5
    pres.save(outFilePath, SaveFormat.Html5, options);
} finally {
    // Dispose of the presentation object
    if (pres != null) {
        pres.dispose();
    }
}
```

try {
	// Export a presentation containing slides transitions, animations, and shapes animations to HTML5
	Html5Options options = new Html5Options();
	options.setAnimateShapes(true);
	options.setAnimateTransitions(true);
	// Save presentation
	pres.save(outFilePath, SaveFormat.Html5, options);
} finally {
	if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
}
```
