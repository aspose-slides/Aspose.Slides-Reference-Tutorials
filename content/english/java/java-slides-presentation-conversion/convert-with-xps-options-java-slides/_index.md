## Introduction to Convert with XPS Options in Java Slides

In the world of Java programming, working with presentation files is a common task. Whether you are creating dynamic reports or interactive slideshows, having the right tools and libraries can greatly simplify your work. One such powerful tool is Aspose.Slides for Java, an API that allows you to manipulate and convert PowerPoint presentations with ease.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Aspose.Slides for Java library downloaded and added to your project.
- A PowerPoint presentation file that you want to convert to XPS format.

## Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries

In your Java project, import the required libraries for Aspose.Slides to work. This includes importing the `com.aspose.slides` package to access its classes and methods.

```java
import com.aspose.slides.*;
```

## Step 2: Specify the Document Directory

Define the path to the directory where your presentation files are located. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your files.

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 3: Load the Presentation

Create an instance of the `Presentation` class and load the PowerPoint presentation file you want to convert. In the provided code, we load a presentation named "Convert_XPS_Options.pptx."

```java
Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir + "Convert_XPS_Options.pptx");
```

## Step 4: Customize Conversion Options

To customize the conversion process, you can create an instance of the `XpsOptions` class. In the example, we set the option to save metafiles as PNG images.

```java
XpsOptions opts = new XpsOptions();
opts.setSaveMetafilesAsPng(true);
```

Feel free to explore other options provided by Aspose.Slides to fine-tune your conversion according to your requirements.

## Step 5: Perform the Conversion

Now that you have loaded the presentation and customized the conversion options, it's time to perform the actual conversion. Use the `save` method of the `Presentation` class to save the presentation in XPS format.

```java
pres.save(dataDir + "XPS_With_Options_out.xps", SaveFormat.Xps, opts);
```

## Step 6: Cleanup Resources

Finally, don't forget to release any allocated resources by disposing of the `Presentation` object.

```java
if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
```
