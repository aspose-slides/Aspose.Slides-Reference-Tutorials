## Introduction Convert PowerPoint to XPS Without XPS Options in Aspose.Slides for Java

In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of converting a PowerPoint presentation to an XPS (XML Paper Specification) document using Aspose.Slides for Java without specifying any XPS options. We will provide you with step-by-step instructions and Java source code for achieving this task.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.Slides for Java: Ensure that you have the Aspose.Slides for Java library installed and configured in your Java project. You can download it from the [Aspose.Slides for Java website](https://downloads.aspose.com/slides/java).

2. Java Development Environment: You should have a Java development environment set up on your computer.

## Step 1: Import Aspose.Slides for Java

In your Java project, import the necessary Aspose.Slides for Java classes at the beginning of your Java file:

```java
import com.aspose.slides.Presentation;
import com.aspose.slides.SaveFormat;
```

## Step 2: Load the PowerPoint Presentation

Now, we'll load the PowerPoint presentation that you want to convert to XPS. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your PowerPoint presentation file:

```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Instantiate a Presentation object that represents a presentation file
Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir + "Convert_XPS.pptx");
```

Ensure that you replace `"Convert_XPS.pptx"` with the actual name of your PowerPoint file.

## Step 3: Save as XPS Without XPS Options

With Aspose.Slides for Java, you can easily save the loaded presentation as an XPS document without specifying any XPS options. Here's how you can do it:

```java
try {
    // Saving the presentation to XPS document
    pres.save(dataDir + "XPS_Output_Without_XPSOption_out.xps", SaveFormat.Xps);
} finally {
    if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
}
```

This code block saves the presentation as an XPS document with the name `"XPS_Output_Without_XPSOption_out.xps"`. You can change the output file name as needed.

## FAQ's

### How do I specify XPS options while converting?

To specify XPS options while converting a PowerPoint presentation, you can use the `XpsOptions` class and set various properties such as image compression and font embedding. If you have specific requirements for XPS conversion, refer to the [Aspose.Slides for Java documentation](https://docs.aspose.com/slides/java/) for more details.

### Are there any additional options for saving in other formats?

Yes, Aspose.Slides for Java provides various output formats besides XPS, such as PDF, TIFF, and HTML. You can specify the desired output format by changing the `SaveFormat` parameter when calling the `save` method. Refer to the documentation for a complete list of supported formats.

### How can I handle exceptions during the conversion process?

You can implement exception handling to gracefully handle any errors that may occur during the conversion process. As shown in the code, a `try` and `finally` block are used to ensure proper resource disposal even if an exception occurs.
