By following this guide, you'll learn how to manipulate text formatting to achieve precise presentation outcomes.
## Prerequisites
Before delving into this tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of Java programming language.
- Familiarity with Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
- Downloaded and installed Aspose.Slides for Java library. You can obtain it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).

## Import Packages
Begin by importing the necessary packages from Aspose.Slides for Java to your Java file:
```java
import com.aspose.slides.AutoShape;
import com.aspose.slides.IAutoShape;
import com.aspose.slides.Presentation;
import javax.imageio.ImageIO;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;
```
### Step 1: Load PowerPoint Presentation
Start by loading your PowerPoint presentation file (`pptxFileName`) and define the output path (`resultPath`) for the processed slide thumbnail:
```java
String pptxFileName = "Your Document Directory";
String resultPath = "Your Output Directory" + "KeepTextFlat_out.png";
Presentation pres = new Presentation(pptxFileName);
```
## Step 2: Access and Manipulate Text Shapes
Access the text shapes within the first slide of the loaded presentation (`pres`). Adjust the `KeepTextFlat` property for each shape accordingly:
```java
try {
    IAutoShape shape1 = (AutoShape) pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().get_Item(0);
    IAutoShape shape2 = (AutoShape) pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().get_Item(1);
    // Set KeepTextFlat property for each shape
    shape1.getTextFrame().getTextFrameFormat().setKeepTextFlat(false);
    shape2.getTextFrame().getTextFrameFormat().setKeepTextFlat(true);
    // Generate thumbnail of the slide and save as PNG
    ImageIO.write(pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getThumbnail(4 / 3f, 4 / 3f), "PNG", new File(resultPath));
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
} finally {
    if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
}
```
