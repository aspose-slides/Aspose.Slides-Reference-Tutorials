## Introduction to Get Values and Unit Scale from Axis in Java Slides

In this tutorial, we will explore how to retrieve values and unit scale from an axis in Java Slides using the Aspose.Slides for Java API. Whether you're working on a data visualization project or need to analyze chart data in your Java applications, understanding how to access axis values is essential. We will walk you through the process step by step, providing code examples along the way.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Environment: Ensure that you have Java installed on your system and are familiar with Java programming concepts.

2. Aspose.Slides for Java: Download and install the Aspose.Slides for Java library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).

## Step 1: Creating a Presentation

To get started, let's create a new presentation using Aspose.Slides for Java:

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Presentation pres = new Presentation();
```

Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path to the directory where you want to save the presentation.

## Step 2: Adding a Chart

Next, we'll add a chart to the presentation. In this example, we'll create an area chart:

```java
Chart chart = (Chart) pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().addChart(ChartType.Area, 100, 100, 500, 350);
chart.validateChartLayout();
```

We've added an area chart to the first slide of the presentation. You can customize the chart type and position as needed.

## Step 3: Retrieving Vertical Axis Values

Now, let's retrieve the values from the vertical axis of the chart:

```java
double maxValue = chart.getAxes().getVerticalAxis().getActualMaxValue();
double minValue = chart.getAxes().getVerticalAxis().getActualMinValue();
```

Here, we're obtaining the maximum and minimum values of the vertical axis. These values can be useful for various data analysis tasks.

## Step 4: Retrieving Horizontal Axis Values

Similarly, we can retrieve values from the horizontal axis:

```java
double majorUnit = chart.getAxes().getHorizontalAxis().getActualMajorUnit();
double minorUnit = chart.getAxes().getHorizontalAxis().getActualMinorUnit();
```

The `majorUnit` and `minorUnit` values represent the major and minor units on the horizontal axis, respectively.

## Step 5: Saving the Presentation

Once we've retrieved the axis values, we can save the presentation:

```java
pres.save(dataDir + "ChartValues.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

This code saves the presentation with the retrieved axis values to a PowerPoint file.

## Complete Source Code For Get Values and Unit Scale from Axis in Java Slides

```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Presentation pres = new Presentation();
try
{
	Chart chart = (Chart) pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().addChart(ChartType.Area, 100, 100, 500, 350);
	chart.validateChartLayout();
	double maxValue = chart.getAxes().getVerticalAxis().getActualMaxValue();
	double minValue = chart.getAxes().getVerticalAxis().getActualMinValue();
	double majorUnit = chart.getAxes().getHorizontalAxis().getActualMajorUnit();
	double minorUnit = chart.getAxes().getHorizontalAxis().getActualMinorUnit();
	// Saving presentation
	pres.save(dataDir + "ErrorBars_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
}
finally
{
	if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
}
```
