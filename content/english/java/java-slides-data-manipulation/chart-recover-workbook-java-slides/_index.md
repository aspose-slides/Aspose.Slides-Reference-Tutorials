## Introduction to Chart Recover Workbook in Java Slides

When working with PowerPoint presentations in Java, you might encounter scenarios where you need to recover workbook data from a chart. This can be a crucial task, especially when dealing with data-driven presentations. Aspose.Slides for Java simplifies this process, and in this guide, we will show you how to do it.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Aspose.Slides for Java library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).

## Step 1: Setting up Your Project

Create a new Java project in your favorite Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and add the Aspose.Slides for Java library to your project's dependencies.

## Step 2: Importing the Necessary Classes

In your Java code, import the required classes from Aspose.Slides for Java:

```java
import com.aspose.slides.*;
```

## Step 3: Loading the Presentation

Load the PowerPoint presentation that contains the chart you want to recover workbook data from:

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
String pptxFile = dataDir + "ExternalWB.pptx";
String outPptxFile = "Path to Output File";
LoadOptions lo = new LoadOptions();
lo.getSpreadsheetOptions().setRecoverWorkbookFromChartCache(true);
Presentation pres = new Presentation(pptxFile, lo);
```

## Step 4: Accessing the Chart Data

Now, you can access the chart data and recover the workbook:

```java
try
{
    IChart chart = (IChart) pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().get_Item(0);
    IChartDataWorkbook wb = chart.getChartData().getChartDataWorkbook();
    // Perform operations on the workbook data here
    pres.save(outPptxFile, SaveFormat.Pptx);
}
finally
{
    if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
}
```
