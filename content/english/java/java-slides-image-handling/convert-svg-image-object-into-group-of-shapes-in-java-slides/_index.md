## Introduction to Convert SVG Image Object into Group of Shapes in Java Slides

In this comprehensive guide, we will explore how to convert an SVG image object into a group of shapes in Java Slides using the Aspose.Slides for Java API. This powerful library enables developers to manipulate PowerPoint presentations programmatically, making it a valuable tool for various tasks, including handling images.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code and step-by-step instructions, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Aspose.Slides for Java library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).

Now that we have everything set up, let's get started.

## Step 1: Import the Necessary Libraries

To begin, you need to import the required libraries for your Java project. Make sure to include Aspose.Slides for Java.

```java
import com.aspose.slides.*;
```

## Step 2: Load the Presentation

Next, you'll need to load the PowerPoint presentation containing the SVG image object. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your document directory.

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir + "image.pptx");
```

## Step 3: Retrieve the SVG Image

Now, let's retrieve the SVG image object from the PowerPoint presentation. We'll assume that the SVG image is on the first slide and is the first shape on that slide.

```java
try
{
    PictureFrame pFrame = (PictureFrame) pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().get_Item(0);
    ISvgImage svgImage = pFrame.getPictureFormat().getPicture().getImage().getSvgImage();
```

## Step 4: Convert SVG Image to Group of Shapes

With the SVG image in hand, we can now convert it into a group of shapes. This can be achieved by adding a new group shape to the slide and removing the source SVG image.

```java
    if (svgImage != null)
    {
        // Convert svg image into a group of shapes
        IGroupShape groupShape = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes()
                .addGroupShape(svgImage, pFrame.getFrame().getX(), pFrame.getFrame().getY(),
                        pFrame.getFrame().getWidth(), pFrame.getFrame().getHeight());

        // Remove the source SVG image from the presentation
        pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().remove(pFrame);
    }
```

## Step 5: Save the Modified Presentation

Once you've successfully converted the SVG image into a group of shapes, save the modified presentation to a new file.

```java
    pres.save(dataDir + "image_group.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
}
finally
{
    pres.dispose();
}
```

Congratulations! You have now learned how to convert an SVG image object into a group of shapes in Java Slides using the Aspose.Slides for Java API.

```java
        // The path to the documents directory.
        String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
        Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir + "image.pptx");
        try
        {
            PictureFrame pFrame = (PictureFrame) pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().get_Item(0);
            ISvgImage svgImage = pFrame.getPictureFormat().getPicture().getImage().getSvgImage();
            if (svgImage != null)
            {
                // Convert svg image into group of shapes
                IGroupShape groupShape = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().
                        addGroupShape(svgImage, pFrame.getFrame().getX(), pFrame.getFrame().getY(),
                                pFrame.getFrame().getWidth(), pFrame.getFrame().getHeight());
                // remove source svg image from presentation
                pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().remove(pFrame);
            }
            pres.save(dataDir + "image_group.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
        }
        finally
        {
            pres.dispose();
        }
```
