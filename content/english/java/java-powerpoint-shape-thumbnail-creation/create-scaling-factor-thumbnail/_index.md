## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of creating a scaling factor thumbnail using Aspose.Slides for Java. Follow these step-by-step instructions to achieve your desired result.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Aspose.Slides for Java library downloaded and set up in your Java project.
- Basic understanding of Java programming language.

## Import Packages
Firstly, import the necessary packages required for working with Aspose.Slides in your Java code. 
```java
import com.aspose.slides.Presentation;
import com.aspose.slides.ShapeThumbnailBounds;
import com.aspose.slides.examples.RunExamples;
import javax.imageio.ImageIO;
import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;
```

Now, let's break down the example provided into multiple steps:
## Step 1: Set the Document Directory

```java
Presentation p = new Presentation(dataDir + "HelloWorld.pptx");
```
Ensure to replace `"HelloWorld.pptx"` with the name of your PowerPoint presentation file.
## Step 3: Create Full Scale Image

```java
BufferedImage bitmap = p.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().get_Item(0).getThumbnail(ShapeThumbnailBounds.Shape, 1, 1);
```
This code retrieves the thumbnail of the first shape on the first slide of the presentation.
## Step 4: Save the Image
Save the generated image to disk in PNG format.
```java
ImageIO.write(bitmap, ".png", new File(dataDir + "Scaling Factor Thumbnail_out.png"));
```
Ensure to replace `"Scaling Factor Thumbnail_out.png"` with the desired output file name.
