## Introduction
In the dynamic world of presentations, creating visually appealing slides with interconnected shapes is crucial for effective communication. Aspose.Slides for .NET provides a powerful solution to achieve this by allowing you to connect shapes using connection sites. This tutorial will guide you through the process of connecting shapes step by step, ensuring that your presentations stand out with seamless visual transitions.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- A basic understanding of C# and .NET programming.
- Aspose.Slides for .NET library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/net/).
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio set up.
## Import Namespaces
Start by importing the necessary namespaces in your C# code:
```csharp
using Aspose.Slides.Export;
using Aspose.Slides;
```
## Step 1: Set up Your Document Directory
Ensure you have a designated directory for your document. If it doesn't exist, create one:
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
bool isExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir);
if (!isExists)
    System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);
```
## Step 2: Create a Presentation
Instantiate the Presentation class to represent your PPTX file:
```csharp
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation())
{
    // Your code for the presentation goes here
}
```
## Step 3: Access and Add Shapes
Access the shapes collection for the selected slide and add the necessary shapes:
```csharp
IShapeCollection shapes = presentation.Slides[0].Shapes;
IConnector connector = shapes.AddConnector(ShapeType.BentConnector3, 0, 0, 10, 10);
IAutoShape ellipse = shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.Ellipse, 0, 100, 100, 100);
IAutoShape rectangle = shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, 100, 200, 100, 100);
```
## Step 4: Join Shapes using Connectors
Connect the shapes using the connector:
```csharp
connector.StartShapeConnectedTo = ellipse;
connector.EndShapeConnectedTo = rectangle;
```
## Step 5: Set Desired Connection Site
Specify the desired connection site index for the connector:
```csharp
uint wantedIndex = 6;
if (ellipse.ConnectionSiteCount > wantedIndex)
{
    connector.StartShapeConnectionSiteIndex = wantedIndex;
}
```
## Step 6: Save Your Presentation
Save your presentation with the connected shapes:
```csharp
presentation.Save(dataDir + "Connecting_Shape_on_desired_connection_site_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
Now you have successfully connected shapes using connection sites in your presentation.
## Conclusion
Aspose.Slides for .NET simplifies the process of connecting shapes, allowing you to create visually engaging presentations effortlessly. By following this step-by-step guide, you can enhance the visual appeal of your slides and effectively convey your message.
