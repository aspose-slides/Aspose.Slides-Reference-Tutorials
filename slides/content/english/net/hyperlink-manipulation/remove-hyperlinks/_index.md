In the world of professional presentations, making sure that your slides look neat and tidy is essential. One common element that often clutters slides is hyperlinks. Whether you're dealing with hyperlinks to websites, documents, or other slides within your presentation, you may want to remove them for a cleaner and more focused look. With Aspose.Slides for .NET, you can easily achieve this task. In this step-by-step guide, we will walk you through the process of removing hyperlinks from slides using Aspose.Slides for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.Slides for .NET: You should have Aspose.Slides for .NET installed and set up in your development environment. If you haven't already, you can obtain it from [Aspose.Slides for .NET documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/).

2. A PowerPoint Presentation: You'll need a PowerPoint presentation (PPTX file) from which you want to remove hyperlinks.

With these prerequisites met, you're ready to start. Let's dive into the step-by-step process of removing hyperlinks from your slides.

## Step 1: Import Namespaces

To begin, you need to import the necessary namespaces in your C# code. These namespaces provide access to the Aspose.Slides for .NET library. Add the following lines to your code:

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;
using Aspose.Slides.Export;
```

## Step 2: Load the Presentation

Now, you need to load the PowerPoint presentation that contains the hyperlinks you want to remove. Ensure you provide the correct path to your presentation file. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Presentation presentation = new Presentation(dataDir + "Hyperlink.pptx");
```

In the code above, replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your document directory and `"Hyperlink.pptx"` with the name of your PowerPoint presentation file.

## Step 3: Remove Hyperlinks

With your presentation loaded, you can proceed to remove the hyperlinks. Aspose.Slides for .NET provides a straightforward method for this purpose:

```csharp
presentation.HyperlinkQueries.RemoveAllHyperlinks();
```

The `RemoveAllHyperlinks()` method removes all hyperlinks from the presentation.

## Step 4: Save the Modified Presentation

After removing the hyperlinks, you should save the modified presentation to a new file. You can choose to save it in the same format (PPTX) or a different one if needed. Here's how to save it as a PPTX file:

```csharp
presentation.Save(dataDir + "RemovedHyperlink_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

Again, replace `"RemovedHyperlink_out.pptx"` with your desired output file name and path.

Congratulations! You've successfully removed hyperlinks from your PowerPoint presentation using Aspose.Slides for .NET. Your slides are now free from distractions, offering a cleaner and more focused viewing experience.
