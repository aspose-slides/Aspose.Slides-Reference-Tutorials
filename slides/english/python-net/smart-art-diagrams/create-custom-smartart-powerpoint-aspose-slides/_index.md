## Implementation Guide

Now let's break down the process of adding and customizing SmartArt in PowerPoint using Aspose.Slides for Python.

### Adding a SmartArt Graphic

#### Overview
Create a new slide and add an organization chart type SmartArt graphic to it:

```python
import aspose.slides as slides

# Create a presentation instance\with slides.Presentation() as presentation:
    # Add SmartArt with specified dimensions at position (10, 10)
    smart = presentation.slides[0].shapes.add_smart_art(
        x=10,
        y=10,
        width=400,
        height=300,
        layout_type=slides.smartart.SmartArtLayoutType.ORGANIZATION_CHART
    )
```

#### Parameters and Method Purpose
- **x, y**: Position of the SmartArt graphic on the slide.
- **width, height**: Dimensions for proper visibility.
- **layout_type**: Specifies the type of SmartArt layout, in this case, an organization chart.

### Customizing the Organization Chart Layout

#### Overview
Customize the first node in our SmartArt graphic by setting its layout to LEFT_HANGING:

```python
# Set the first node to left hanging layout
smart.nodes[0].organization_chart_layout = slides.smartart.OrganizationChartLayoutType.LEFT_HANGING
```

#### Explanation of Key Configuration Options
- **OrganizationChartLayoutType**: Determines how nodes are displayed, enhancing readability and aesthetic appeal.

Finally, save your presentation to a specified directory:

```python
# Save the presentation with SmartArt\presentation.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/smart_art_organization_chart_layout_out.pptx\
