#### Step 2: Access the First Slide
```python
    slide = pres.slides[0]  # Access the first slide
```
- **Explanation**: Access the first slide to add SmartArt.
#### Step 3: Add a SmartArt Shape
```python
        smart = slide.shapes.add_smart_art(
            0, 0, 400, 400, slides.SmartArtLayoutType.BASIC_BLOCK_LIST
        )
```
- **Explanation**: This function adds a SmartArt shape with specified coordinates and layout type.
#### Step 4: Save the Presentation
```python
    pres.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/smart_art_add_out.pptx")
