# How to Create a Pie of Pie Chart in PowerPoint Using Aspose.Slides for Python

Creating visually appealing charts like the Pie of Pie chart can significantly enhance your PowerPoint presentations by making complex information more digestible. This tutorial guides you through creating a Pie of Pie chart using Aspose.Slides for Python.

## What You'll Learn

- Setting up Aspose.Slides for Python
- Steps to create a PowerPoint presentation with a Pie of Pie chart
- Configuring data labels and series group options for better readability
- Practical applications of the Pie of Pie chart in presentations

Let's dive into setting up your environment and implementing these features.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Python Installed**: Python 3.6 or higher is recommended.
- **Aspose.Slides for Python**: Install using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install aspose.slides
  ```
- **License**: Obtain a free trial license from Aspose to explore full features without limitations.

#### Knowledge Prerequisites

Basic familiarity with Python programming and understanding of PowerPoint presentations will be beneficial. If you're new to these, consider exploring introductory resources first.

### Setting Up Aspose.Slides for Python

To get started with Aspose.Slides for Python, follow these simple steps:

1. **Installation**: Use pip to install the library:
   ```bash
   pip install aspose.slides
   ```

2. **License Acquisition**: 
   - Visit [Aspose's Purchase Page](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy) to purchase a license or obtain a temporary free trial.
   - Apply your license using the following code snippet in your project:
     ```python
     import aspose.slides as slides

     # Load the license file
     license = slides.License()
     license.set_license("path_to_your_license.lic")
     ```

3. **Basic Initialization**:
   Start by importing Aspose.Slides and initiating a presentation object.

### Implementation Guide

#### Feature 1: Create Presentation with Chart

This feature will demonstrate how to create a PowerPoint presentation and add a Pie of Pie chart to the first slide.

##### Adding the Chart

Start by creating a new presentation and adding a Pie of Pie chart at position (50, 50) on the first slide:

```python
import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation() as presentation:
    # Add a 'Pie of Pie' chart with specified dimensions
    chart = presentation.slides[0].shapes.add_chart(
        slides.charts.ChartType.PIE_OF_PIE, 50, 50, 500, 400)
```

##### Configuring Data Labels

To enhance readability, configure the data labels to display values:

```python
# Enable value display in data labels for better clarity
chart.chart_data.series[0].labels.default_data_label_format.show_value = True
```

##### Setting Pie of Pie Options

Configure specific properties for the Pie of Pie chart, such as second pie size and split position:

```python
# Set second pie size and splitting properties
chart.chart_data.series[0].parent_series_group.second_pie_size = 149
chart.chart_data.series[0].parent_series_group.pie_split_by = slides.charts.PieSplitType.BY_PERCENTAGE
chart.chart_data.series[0].parent_series_group.pie_split_position = 53
```

##### Saving the Presentation

Finally, save your presentation to a desired directory:

```python
# Save the presentation with the chart
presentation.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/charts_second_plot_options_out.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```

### Practical Applications

The Pie of Pie chart is versatile and can be used in various scenarios:

1. **Business Reports**: Visualize data distribution across different departments or products.
2. **Academic Projects**: Present survey results showing major themes alongside less significant findings.
3. **Financial Analysis**: Compare primary expenses with secondary costs in a budget report.

### Performance Considerations

For optimal performance when using Aspose.Slides:

- Minimize the number of slides and charts if possible to reduce memory usage.
- Regularly clean up unused resources or references in your code.
- Use Python's built-in garbage collection (`gc` module) to manage memory effectively.
