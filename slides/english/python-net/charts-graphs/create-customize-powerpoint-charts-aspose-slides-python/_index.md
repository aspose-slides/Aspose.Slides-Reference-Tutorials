    # Add your code here to manipulate the presentation
    pass
```

## Implementation Guide
Let's break down the implementation into three main features:

### Create and Add Chart
#### Overview
This feature demonstrates adding a line chart with markers to a PowerPoint slide.

**Steps:**
1. **Open Presentation**: Start by opening a new or existing presentation.
2. **Select Slide**: Choose the slide where you want to add the chart.
3. **Add Line Chart**: Use `add_chart` method to insert the chart.
4. **Save Presentation**: Save your changes with the updated slide.

**Code Implementation:**
```python
import aspose.slides as slides

def add_chart_to_slide():
    # Open a new Presentation
    with slides.Presentation() as presentation:
        # Select the first slide
        slide = presentation.slides[0]
        
        # Add a line chart with markers to the selected slide at position (0, 0) and size (400, 400)
        chart = slide.shapes.add_chart(
            slides.charts.ChartType.LINE_WITH_MARKERS, 0, 0, 400, 400
        )
        
        # Save the presentation with the added chart to disk
        presentation.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/charts_set_marker_options_out.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```

### Modify Chart Data
#### Overview
Learn how to clear existing data and add new series of points to a chart.

**Steps:**
1. **Access Chart**: Retrieve the chart from your slide.
2. **Clear Existing Series**: Remove any pre-existing data series.
3. **Add New Data Points**: Insert new data into the series.
4. **Save Changes**: Persist changes to the presentation file.

**Code Implementation:**
```python
import aspose.slides as slides

def modify_chart_data():
    with slides.Presentation() as presentation:
        slide = presentation.slides[0]
        chart = slide.shapes.add_chart(slides.charts.ChartType.LINE_WITH_MARKERS, 0, 0, 400, 400)
        
        # Access the default worksheet index for the chart data
        default_worksheet_index = 0
        fact = chart.chart_data.chart_data_workbook
        
        # Clear any existing series in the chart
        chart.chart_data.series.clear()
        
        # Add a new series with specified name and type to the chart
        chart.chart_data.series.add(fact.get_cell(default_worksheet_index, 1, 1, "Series 1"), chart.type)
        
        # Access the first (and only) series in the chart data
        series = chart.chart_data.series[0]
        
        # Add data points to the series and set their values
        point = series.data_points.add_data_point_for_line_series(fact.get_cell(default_worksheet_index, 1, 1, 4.5))
        point.value = 4.5
        
        point = series.data_points.add_data_point_for_line_series(fact.get_cell(default_worksheet_index, 2, 1, 2.5))
        point.value = 2.5
        
        point = series.data_points.add_data_point_for_line_series(fact.get_cell(default_worksheet_index, 3, 1, 3.5))
        point.value = 3.5
        
        point = series.data_points.add_data_point_for_line_series(fact.get_cell(default_worksheet_index, 4, 1, 4.5))
        point.value = 4.5
        
        # Save the updated presentation to disk
        presentation.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/charts_set_marker_options_out.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```

### Set Chart Markers with Images
#### Overview
Enhance your chart by setting custom image markers for data points.

**Steps:**
1. **Add Line Chart**: Insert a line chart into the slide.
2. **Load Images**: Add images to be used as markers from your document directory.
3. **Set Image Markers**: Apply these images to specific data points on the series.
4. **Adjust Marker Size**: Customize the size of image markers for better visibility.

**Code Implementation:**
```python
import aspose.slides as slides

def set_chart_markers_with_images():
    # Open a new Presentation
    with slides.Presentation() as presentation:
        slide = presentation.slides[0]
        
        # Add a line chart with markers to the selected slide at position (0, 0) and size (400, 400)
        chart = slide.shapes.add_chart(
            slides.charts.ChartType.LINE_WITH_MARKERS, 0, 0, 400, 400
        )
        
        # Access the default worksheet index for the chart data
        default_worksheet_index = 0
        fact = chart.chart_data.chart_data_workbook
        
        # Clear any existing series in the chart and add a new one
        chart.chart_data.series.clear()
        chart.chart_data.series.add(fact.get_cell(default_worksheet_index, 1, 1, "Series 1"), chart.type)
        
        # Access the first (and only) series in the chart data
        series = chart.chart_data.series[0]
        
        # Load images and add them to presentation's image collection
        image1 = slides.Images.from_file("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/image1.jpg")
        imgx1 = presentation.images.add_image(image1)
        
        image2 = slides.Images.from_file("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/image2.jpg")
        imgx2 = presentation.images.add_image(image2)
        
        # Add data points and set their marker images
        point = series.data_points.add_data_point_for_line_series(fact.get_cell(default_worksheet_index, 1, 1, 4.5))
        point.marker.format.fill.fill_type = slides.FillType.PICTURE
        point.marker.format.fill.picture_fill_format.picture.image = imgx1
        
        point = series.data_points.add_data_point_for_line_series(fact.get_cell(default_worksheet_index, 2, 1, 2.5))
        point.marker.format.fill.fill_type = slides.FillType.PICTURE
        point.marker.format.fill.picture_fill_format.picture.image = imgx2
        
        # Save the presentation with the customized markers to disk
        presentation.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/charts_with_image_markers_out.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```
