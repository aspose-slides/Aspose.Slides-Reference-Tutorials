Ready to dive into creating impactful charts? Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- **Python Environment**: You should be running Python 3.6 or later.
- **Aspose.Slides for Python**: We'll install this package using pip.
- Basic knowledge of Python programming and familiarity with PowerPoint presentations.

### Setting Up Aspose.Slides for Python

To use Aspose.Slides, you need to have it installed in your environment. You can easily do this via pip:

```bash
pip install aspose.slides
```

Next, acquire a license if necessary. Aspose offers different licensing options including free trials, temporary licenses, and full purchase plans. Visit the [Aspose website](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy) to explore your options.

Once installed, initialize Aspose.Slides in your script like so:

```python
import aspose.slides as slides

# Initialize presentation object
class LineChartWithMarkers:
    def __init__(self):
        with slides.Presentation() as pres:
            self.slide = pres.slides[0]
            self.chart = self.add_line_chart_with_markers()
            self.configure_data_series_and_categories()
            self.customize_legend_and_save(pres)

    def add_line_chart_with_markers(self):
        """Demonstrates how to create a line chart with markers using Aspose.Slides."""
        # Add a line chart with markers
        return self.slide.shapes.add_chart(slides.charts.ChartType.LINE_WITH_MARKERS, 10, 10, 400, 400)
    
    def configure_data_series_and_categories(self):
        fact = self.chart.chart_data.chart_data_workbook
        # Clear previous series and categories
        self.chart.chart_data.series.clear()
        self.chart.chart_data.categories.clear()
        
        # Add categories
        categories = ["C1", "C2", "C3", "C4"]
        for i, category in enumerate(categories):
            self.chart.chart_data.categories.add(fact.get_cell(0, i + 1, 0, category))
        
    def add_series(self, name, data_points):
        series = self.chart.chart_data.series.add(fact.get_cell(0, 0, len(data_points) + 1, name), self.chart.type)
        for i, value in enumerate(data_points):
            if value is not None:
                series.data_points.add_data_point_for_line_series(fact.get_cell(0, i + 1, len(data_points) + 1, value))

    def customize_legend_and_save(self, pres):
        # Configure legend
        self.chart.has_legend = True
        self.chart.legend.overlay = False

        # Save to a file
        output_directory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"
        pres.save(f"{output_directory}/charts_default_markers_out.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)

class LineChartWithMarkers()
```

## Implementation Guide

### Creating a Line Chart with Markers

#### Overview

This feature enables you to add a line chart enhanced with markers directly to your PowerPoint slides, making it easier to highlight key data points.

#### Steps for Implementation

**1. Add a Line Chart to Your Slide**

Start by creating or opening a presentation and adding a chart shape:

```python
def create_line_chart_with_markers():
    """Demonstrates how to create a line chart with markers using Aspose.Slides."""
    # Create a presentation object
    with slides.Presentation() as pres:
        slide = pres.slides[0]
        
        # Add a line chart with markers
        chart = slide.shapes.add_chart(slides.charts.ChartType.LINE_WITH_MARKERS, 10, 10, 400, 400)
```

**2. Configure Data Series and Categories**

Clear any existing data and set up your categories:

```python
        fact = chart.chart_data.chart_data_workbook
        
        # Clear previous series and categories
        chart.chart_data.series.clear()
        chart.chart_data.categories.clear()
        
        # Add categories
        categories = ["C1", "C2", "C3", "C4"]
        for i, category in enumerate(categories):
            chart.chart_data.categories.add(fact.get_cell(0, i + 1, 0, category))
```

**3. Populate Series with Data Points**

Add data to your series:

```python
        # First series
        series = chart.chart_data.series.add(fact.get_cell(0, 0, 1, "Series 1"), chart.type)
        self.add_series(series, [24, 23, -10, None])
        
        # Second series
        self.add_series(chart.chart_data.series.add(fact.get_cell(0, 0, 2, "Series 2")), [30, 10, 60, 40])
```

**4. Customize Legend and Save Presentation**

Finally, adjust the legend settings and save your presentation:

```python
        # Configure legend
        chart.has_legend = True
        chart.legend.overlay = False
        
        # Save to a file
        pres.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/charts_default_markers_out.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure you have the correct version of Aspose.Slides installed.
- Verify that your Python environment is properly set up and can access external libraries.
