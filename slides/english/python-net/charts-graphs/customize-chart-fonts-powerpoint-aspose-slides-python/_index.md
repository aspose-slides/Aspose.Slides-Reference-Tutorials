# How to Customize Chart Fonts in PowerPoint Using Aspose.Slides for Python

## Introduction
Are you looking to enhance the visual appeal of your charts in PowerPoint presentations using Python? You're not alone! Many developers face challenges when attempting to customize chart fonts programmatically. This guide will take you through setting font properties for charts in PowerPoint using **Aspose.Slides for Python**. By mastering these techniques, you can create visually compelling and professional-looking slides effortlessly.

In this tutorial, we'll cover:
- Setting up Aspose.Slides for Python
- Customizing chart fonts with ease
- Practical applications for your projects

Let's get started by ensuring you have everything ready!

### Prerequisites
Before diving in, make sure you have the following prerequisites covered:
1. **Python Environment**: Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher).
2. **Aspose.Slides for Python**: You'll need this library to manipulate PowerPoint files.
3. **Basic Knowledge**: Familiarity with Python programming and a basic understanding of working with libraries will be helpful.

## Setting Up Aspose.Slides for Python
To begin, youâ€™ll need to install the `aspose.slides` library using pip:

```bash
pip install aspose.slides
```

### License Acquisition Steps
- **Free Trial**: Download a free trial from [Aspose's official site](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/python-net/).
- **Temporary License**: For more extensive testing, acquire a temporary license through their [purchase page](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
- **Purchase**: If you find the tool invaluable for your needs, consider purchasing a full license from the [Aspose purchase site](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

Once installed and licensed, initialize Aspose.Slides in Python:

```python
import aspose.slides as slides

# Initialize Presentation object\with slides.Presentation() as pres:
    # Your code goes here
```

## Implementation Guide
In this section, we will explore how to set chart font properties step-by-step.

### Adding a Clustered Column Chart
First, let's add a clustered column chart to our presentation:

```python
# Add a clustered column chart at the specified position and size.
chart = pres.slides[0].shapes.add_chart(
    slides.charts.ChartType.CLUSTERED_COLUMN, 100, 100, 500, 400
)
```
**Explanation**: This snippet adds a new chart to the first slide of your presentation. The `add_chart` method requires you to specify the chart type and its position and size on the slide.

### Setting Font Properties
Next, let's set the font height for text within our chart:

```python
# Set the font height for text in the chart.
chart.text_format.portion_format.font_height = 20
```
**Explanation**: This line adjusts the font size of all text portions within your chart. The `font_height` property is specified in points, and you can adjust this value to suit your design needs.

### Displaying Data Labels
To enhance readability, we'll display values on data labels:

```python
# Display values on the data labels of the first series.
chart.chart_data.series[0].labels.default_data_label_format.show_value = True
```
**Explanation**: This setting ensures that each data point in the first series shows its value. This is especially useful for conveying precise information at a glance.

### Saving Your Presentation
Finally, save your presentation to the desired location:

```python
# Save the presentation to a specified output directory.
pres.save(
    "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/charts_font_properties_for_chart_out.pptx\
