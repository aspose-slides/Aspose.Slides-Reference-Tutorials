## Implementation Guide
### Save Presentation as Slide Master View
This feature is essential for managing slide layouts and ensuring consistency across your presentation.

#### Step 1: Open the Presentation
Use a context manager to handle resource management efficiently:

```python
with slides.Presentation() as presentation:
    # Code execution within this block ensures resources are managed properly.
```

#### Step 2: Set the View Type
Switch the view type of the presentation to SLIDE_MASTER_VIEW:

```python
# Setting the last viewed slide type to Slide Master
presentation.view_properties.last_view = slides.ViewType.SLIDE_MASTER_VIEW
```
This step is crucial for accessing and editing master slides.

#### Step 3: Save the Presentation
Finally, save your presentation in the desired format (PPTX):

```python
# Saving the modified presentation with predefined view type set to Slide Master
presentation.save('YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/save_as_predefined_view_type_out.pptx', 
                  slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
