## Implementation Guide

This section guides you through setting hyperlink colors within a PowerPoint presentation.

### Set Hyperlink Color Feature

#### Overview

Customize the color of hyperlinks embedded within text shapes using Aspose.Slides for Python. This enhances readability and visual appeal.

##### Step 1: Create a New Presentation

Create an instance of a presentation:

```python
with slides.Presentation() as presentation:
    # Your code here
```

##### Step 2: Add a Shape with Text

Add a rectangle shape to the first slide and insert text that includes a hyperlink.

```python
shape1 = presentation.slides[0].shapes.add_auto_shape(
    slides.ShapeType.RECTANGLE, 100, 100, 450, 50, False)

shape1.add_text_frame("This is a sample of colored hyperlink.")
```

##### Step 3: Set Hyperlink Properties

Assign the hyperlink and set its color. The `hyperlink_click` property specifies where the link should navigate upon clicking.

```python
shape1.text_frame.paragraphs[0].portions[0].portion_format.hyperlink_click = slides.Hyperlink(
    "https://www.aspose.com/")
# Set the color source for hyperlink to portion format and define the fill type and color.
shape1.text_frame.paragraphs[0].portions[0].portion_format.hyperlink_click.color_source = slides.HyperlinkColorSource.PORTION_FORMAT
shape1.text_frame.paragraphs[0].portions[0].portion_format.fill_format.fill_type = slides.FillType.SOLID
shape1.text_frame.paragraphs[0].portions[0].portion_format.fill_format.solid_fill_color.color = drawing.Color.red
```

##### Step 4: Save the Presentation

Save your presentation to a specified directory:

```python\presentation.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/hyperlink_set_color_out.pptx\
{{< /blocks/products/pf/tutorial-page-section >}}
{{< /blocks/products/pf/main-container >}}
