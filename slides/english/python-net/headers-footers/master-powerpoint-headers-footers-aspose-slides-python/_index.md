## Implementation Guide

### Feature 1: Header and Footer Management for Notes Master Slide

**Overview:** 
This feature lets you control header and footer settings across all notes slides in a presentation. It's perfect for maintaining consistency throughout your document.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:
##### Load the Presentation
```python
def manage_notes_master_header_footer():
    # Open an existing PowerPoint file
    with slides.Presentation("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/welcome-to-powerpoint.pptx") as presentation:
```

##### Access and Modify Master Notes Slide Header/Footer
```python
        # Retrieve the master notes slide manager
        master_notes_slide = presentation.master_notes_slide_manager.master_notes_slide

        if master_notes_slide is not None:
            header_footer_manager = master_notes_slide.header_footer_manager

            # Set visibility for headers, footers, and other placeholders
            header_footer_manager.set_header_and_child_headers_visibility(True)
            header_footer_manager.set_footer_and_child_footers_visibility(True)
            header_footer_manager.set_slide_number_and_child_slide_numbers_visibility(True)
            header_footer_manager.set_date_time_and_child_date_times_visibility(True)

            # Define text for headers, footers, and date-time placeholders
            header_footer_manager.set_header_and_child_headers_text("Header text")
            header_footer_manager.set_footer_and_child_footers_text("Footer text")
            header_footer_manager.set_date_time_and_child_date_times_text("Date and time text")
```
##### Save the Presentation
```python
        # Write changes to a new file
        presentation.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/notes_MasterNotesHeaderFooter_out.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```

### Feature 2: Header and Footer Management for Individual Notes Slide

**Overview:** 
Tailor headers and footers on individual notes slides, allowing for custom settings per slide.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:
##### Load the Presentation
```python
def manage_individual_notes_slide_header_footer():
    # Open an existing PowerPoint file
    with slides.Presentation("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/welcome-to-powerpoint.pptx") as presentation:
```

##### Access and Modify Individual Notes Slide Header/Footer
```python
        # Get the first notes slide manager (for example purposes)
        notes_slide = presentation.slides[0].notes_slide_manager.notes_slide

        if notes_slide is not None:
            header_footer_manager = notes_slide.header_footer_manager

            # Set visibility for headers, footers, and other placeholders
            if not header_footer_manager.is_header_visible:
                header_footer_manager.set_header_visibility(True)
            if not header_footer_manager.is_footer_visible:
                header_footer_manager.set_footer_visibility(True)
            if not header_footer_manager.is_slide_number_visible:
                header_footer_manager.set_slide_number_visibility(True)
            if not header_footer_manager.is_date_time_visible:
                header_footer_manager.set_date_time_visibility(True)

            # Define text for headers, footers, and date-time placeholders
            header_footer_manager.set_header_text("New header text")
            header_footer_manager.set_footer_text("New footer text")
            header_footer_manager.set_date_time_text("New date and time text")
```
##### Save the Presentation
```python
        # Write changes to a new file
        presentation.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/notes_IndividualNotesHeaderFooter_out.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```
