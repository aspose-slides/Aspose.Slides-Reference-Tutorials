# Set PowerPoint Read-Only & Count Slides with Python

## Introduction
Have you ever faced the challenge of distributing a presentation while ensuring it remains unaltered? Or perhaps you've wanted an easy way to verify how many slides are in your presentation without opening it? With **Aspose.Slides for Python**, these tasks become straightforward. This tutorial will guide you through setting PowerPoint presentations as read-only and counting slides using Aspose.Slides, offering a robust solution for managing your PowerPoint files programmatically.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to set write protection on a PowerPoint presentation.
- How to save a PowerPoint file with read-only restrictions.
- How to load a presentation and count the number of slides efficiently.

Let's dive into how you can achieve these tasks seamlessly in Python.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have:
- **Python 3.6+** installed on your system.
- Access to a command-line interface for installing packages.

You will also need to install Aspose.Slides for Python. This powerful library enables advanced manipulation of PowerPoint files right from your Python environment. While the free version allows limited functionality, acquiring a license (either through a free trial or purchase) expands capabilities significantly.

## Setting Up Aspose.Slides for Python
To start working with Aspose.Slides in Python, you need to install it first. Here’s how:

### pip Installation
Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install aspose.slides
```

This will download and install the latest version of Aspose.Slides for Python.

### License Acquisition Steps
1. **Free Trial**: Start with a free trial to explore basic functionalities.
2. **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license to unlock full features during your evaluation period.
3. **Purchase**: Consider purchasing a license for continued access and support.

Once you have your license file, load it in your script like this:

```python
class LicenseLoader:
    def __init__(self):
        self.license = aspose.slides.License()

    def set_license(self, path_to_license_file):
        self.license.set_license(path_to_license_file)
```

## Implementation Guide
In this section, we’ll break down the implementation into two main features: setting a presentation as read-only and counting slides.

### Feature 1: Save Presentation as Read-Only
#### Overview
This feature allows you to set write protection on a PowerPoint file, ensuring it cannot be modified without entering a password. This is particularly useful for distributing presentations that should remain unchanged by the recipient.

#### Steps
##### Step 1: Instantiate a Presentation Object
Begin by creating a `Presentation` object. This represents your PPT file in Python.

```python
import aspose.slides as slides

class ReadWriteProtection:
    def __init__(self, password):
        self.password = password

    def set_write_protection(self, presentation_path, output_directory):
        with slides.Presentation(presentation_path) as presentation:
            presentation.protection_manager.set_write_protection(self.password)
            presentation.save(f"{output_directory}/save_as_read_only_out.pptx\
