# How to Add and Display Comments on PowerPoint Slides Using Aspose.Slides for Python: A Step-by-Step Guide

## Introduction

Collaborating on PowerPoint presentations often requires leaving feedback or tracking discussions directly on the slides. With Aspose.Slides for Python, adding and displaying comments is straightforward, enhancing your collaborative efforts.

In this tutorial, we'll guide you through using Aspose.Slides for Python to add comments to specific slides and access them easily. This feature is crucial for anyone involved in creating or reviewing presentations who wants to streamline communication directly within their slides.

**What You’ll Learn:**
- Setting up Aspose.Slides for Python.
- Step-by-step instructions on adding slide comments.
- Techniques for accessing and displaying comments from specific authors.
- Practical applications for managing comments in presentations.
- Performance considerations when using Aspose.Slides.

Before we dive into the implementation, let’s ensure you have everything set up correctly.

### Prerequisites

To follow along with this guide, you'll need:
- Python installed on your machine (version 3.6 or later is recommended).
- Basic understanding of Python programming.
- Familiarity with handling PowerPoint files programmatically.

## Setting Up Aspose.Slides for Python

Aspose.Slides for Python is a powerful library that enables developers to manipulate PowerPoint presentations, including adding comments to slides.

**Installation:**

To install the package, run:
```bash
pip install aspose.slides
```

After installation, you can start using Aspose.Slides by importing it into your script. While there's a free trial available, consider acquiring a license for uninterrupted use. You can obtain a temporary license or purchase one through the [Aspose website](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

## Implementation Guide

Let’s break down the implementation into two main features: adding slide comments and accessing/displaying them.

### Adding Slide Comments

This feature allows you to add comments to specific slides in your PowerPoint presentation, enhancing collaboration and feedback mechanisms.

#### Step 1: Import Required Libraries

Start by importing necessary modules:
```python\import aspose.pydrawing as drawing
import aspose.slides as slides
from datetime import date
```

#### Step 2: Create a Presentation Instance

Initialize a presentation object within a context manager to ensure proper resource management:
```python
with slides.Presentation() as presentation:
    # Add an empty slide using the first layout
    presentation.slides.add_empty_slide(presentation.layout_slides[0])
```

#### Step 3: Add Comment Author and Position

Define who is adding the comment and where it will appear on the slide:
```python
# Add a comment author
author = presentation.comment_authors.add_author("Jawad\
