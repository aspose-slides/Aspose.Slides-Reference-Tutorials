# Mastering Aspose.Slides for Python: Modifying PowerPoint ActiveX Controls

In today's dynamic digital landscape, customizing Microsoft PowerPoint presentations is essential for creating engaging content. Whether you're developing interactive training modules or enhancing business presentations with user input capabilities, modifying PowerPoint ActiveX controls can significantly boost your presentation's functionality. This tutorial explores using Aspose.Slides for Python to change TextBox text and button captions, substitute images, reposition, or remove ActiveX controls from slides.

## What You'll Learn
- How to modify TextBox text and button captions in PowerPoint presentations.
- Techniques for substituting images within ActiveX controls.
- Methods to reposition or remove ActiveX controls effectively.
- Practical applications of these features in real-world scenarios.

Before diving into Aspose.Slides for Python, let's review the prerequisites.

## Prerequisites
To follow this tutorial, ensure you have:
- **Python**: Version 3.6 or higher installed on your system.
- **Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET**: This can be installed using pip.
- A basic understanding of Python programming and familiarity with PowerPoint's structure.

### Environment Setup Requirements
1. **Install Aspose.Slides**:
   Use the following command to install Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET:

   ```bash
   pip install aspose.slides
   ```

2. **License Acquisition**: 
   Start by obtaining a [free trial license](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/python-net/) or apply for a temporary license to explore full capabilities without limitations.

3. **Basic Initialization**:
   Import the necessary modules and load your PowerPoint document as shown below:

   ```python
   import aspose.slides as slides

   with slides.Presentation("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/activex_master.pptm") as presentation:
       pass  # Your code will go here.
   ```

## Implementation Guide
### Feature: Change TextBox Text and Substitute Image
#### Overview
This feature allows you to update the text within a TextBox ActiveX control and replace its associated image, useful for personalizing presentations or dynamically updating content.

##### Step-by-Step Guide
1. **Load the Presentation**:
   Begin by loading your PowerPoint presentation containing the ActiveX controls.

   ```python
def change_textbox_and_image():
    with slides.Presentation("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/activex_master.pptm") as presentation:
        slide = presentation.slides[0]
```
2. **Access the TextBox Control**:
   Access the specific control you intend to modify.

   ```python
        control = slide.controls[0]
        if control.name == "TextBox1" and control.properties is not None:
            new_text = "Changed text"
            # Remove existing property value for 'Value'
            control.properties.remove("Value")
            # Add the new text as a property
            control.properties.add("Value", new_text)
```
3. **Create Substitute Image**:
   Generate an image to replace the original content during ActiveX activation.

   ```python
            import aspose.pydrawing as drawing

            # Create an image with specified dimensions
            image = drawing.Bitmap(int(control.frame.width), int(control.frame.height))
            with drawing.Graphics.from_image(image) as graphics:
                with drawing.SolidBrush(drawing.Color.from_known_color(drawing.KnownColor.WINDOW)) as brush:
                    graphics.fill_rectangle(brush, 0, 0, image.width, image.height)
                  
                font = drawing.Font("Arial", 14.0)
                with drawing.SolidBrush(drawing.Color.from_known_color(drawing.KnownColor.WINDOW_TEXT)) as brush:
                    graphics.draw_string(new_text, font, brush, 10.0, 4.0)

                # Add border lines for a polished look
                with drawing.Pen(drawing.Color.from_known_color(drawing.KnownColor.CONTROL_DARK), 1.0) as pen:
                    graphics.draw_lines(pen, [
                        drawing.PointF(0, image.height - 1),
                        drawing.PointF(0, 0),
                        drawing.PointF(image.width - 1, 0)
                    ])
```
4. **Add the Image to Presentation**:
   Finally, add this image as a substitute for the ActiveX control.

   ```python
                # Add the created image to presentation images
                control.substitute_picture_format.picture.image = presentation.images.add_image(image)
```
### Feature: Change Button Caption and Substitute Image
#### Overview
Update button captions within your presentation's ActiveX controls, providing dynamic user interaction possibilities.

##### Step-by-Step Guide
1. **Load the Presentation**:
   As before, start by loading the PowerPoint file.

   ```python
def change_button_caption_and_image():
    with slides.Presentation("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/activex_master.pptm") as presentation:
        slide = presentation.slides[0]
```
2. **Access the Button Control**:
   Identify and modify the button control's caption.

   ```python
        control = slide.controls[1]
        if control.name == "CommandButton1" and control.properties is not None:
            new_caption = "MessageBox"
            control.properties.remove("Caption")
            control.properties.add("Caption", new_caption)
```
3. **Create Substitute Image**:
   Generate an image for visual replacement.

   ```python
            # Create a bitmap for the button's dimensions
            image = drawing.Bitmap(int(control.frame.width), int(control.frame.height))
            with drawing.Graphics.from_image(image) as graphics:
                with drawing.SolidBrush(drawing.Color.from_known_color(drawing.KnownColor.CONTROL)) as brush:
                    graphics.fill_rectangle(brush, 0, 0, image.width, image.height)

                font = drawing.Font("Arial", 14.0)
                with drawing.SolidBrush(drawing.Color.from_known_color(drawing.KnownColor.WINDOW_TEXT)) as brush:
                    textSize = graphics.measure_string(new_caption, font, 1000)
                    graphics.draw_string(new_caption, font, brush, (image.width - textSize.width) / 2, (image.height - textSize.height) / 2)

                # Add border lines for aesthetics
                with drawing.Pen(drawing.Color.from_known_color(drawing.KnownColor.CONTROL_LIGHT_LIGHT), 1.0) as pen:
                    graphics.draw_lines(pen, [
                        drawing.PointF(0, image.height - 1),
                        drawing.PointF(0, 0),
                        drawing.PointF(image.width - 1, 0)
                    ])
```
4. **Add the Image to Presentation**:
   Save the newly created image in your presentation.

   ```python
                control.substitute_picture_format.picture.image = presentation.images.add_image(image)
```
### Feature: Move ActiveX Controls Down and Save Presentation
#### Overview
Learn how to reposition ActiveX controls within a slide, enhancing layout flexibility.

##### Step-by-Step Guide
1. **Load the Presentation**:
   Open your PowerPoint document for editing.

   ```python
def move_active_x_controls_and_save():
    with slides.Presentation("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/activex_master.pptm") as presentation:
        slide = presentation.slides[0]
```
2. **Reposition Controls**:
   Iterate through controls to adjust their positions.

   ```python
        for ctl in slide.controls:
            frame = ctl.frame
            # Move each control down by 100 points on the y-axis
            ctl.frame = slides.ShapeFrame(
                frame.x, frame.y + 100, frame.width, frame.height,
                # Rest of your code to move and save controls
```
