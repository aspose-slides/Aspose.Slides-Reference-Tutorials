## Implementation Guide
Now, let's break down the conversion process into manageable steps.
### Load the Presentation

```
- **File Path Parameter**: Specify the path where your .pptx file is located.
### Configure Notes and Comments
**Overview**: Customize how notes and comments appear in the HTML5 output.
```python
def configure_layout():
    layout_options = slides.export.NotesCommentsLayoutingOptions()
    layout_options.notes_position = slides.export.NotesPositions.BOTTOM_TRUNCATED
    return layout_options
```
- **Notes Position**: Set to `BOTTOM_TRUNCATED` for compact and readable notes.
### Set Up HTML5 Conversion Options
**Overview**: Define the conversion settings, including output paths and layout options.
```python
def setup_html5_conversion(layout_options):
    html5_options = slides.export.Html5Options()
    html5_options.output_path = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/Html5NotesResult"
    html5_options.notes_comments_layouting = layout_options
    return html5_options
```
- **Output Path**: Specify where the HTML5 file will be saved.
### Save as HTML5
**Overview**: Execute the conversion and save your presentation in HTML5 format.
```python
def convert_to_html(presentation, output_path, html5_options):
