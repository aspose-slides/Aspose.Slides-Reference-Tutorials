## Implementation Guide

This section guides you through converting PowerPoint presentations to PDF using Aspose.Slides for Python.

### Converting Presentation to PDF

#### Overview

Convert .pptx files into PDFs effortlessly, ensuring compatibility across platforms.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Load the Presentation**

Load your PowerPoint file from a specific directory:
```python
def load_presentation(input_file_path):
    presentation = slides.Presentation(input_file_path)
    return presentation
```

**2. Save as PDF**

Save the loaded presentation as a PDF file:
```python
def save_as_pdf(presentation, output_file_path):
    presentation.save(output_file_path, slides.export.SaveFormat.PDF)
```

#### Full Code Example

Combine these steps into a complete function:
```python
import aspose.slides as slides

def convert_to_pdf(input_file_path, output_file_path):
    with slides.Presentation(input_file_path) as presentation:
        presentation.save(output_file_path, slides.export.SaveFormat.PDF)

# Example usage
convert_to_pdf("path/to/presentation.pptx", "output/path/output.pdf")
```

**Parameters Explained:**
- `input_file_path`: Path to your source PowerPoint file.
- `output_file_path`: Desired path for the resulting PDF.

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- Verify that input file paths are correct and accessible.
