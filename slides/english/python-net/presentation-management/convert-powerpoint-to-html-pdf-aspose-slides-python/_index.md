license.set_license(template_license)
```

## Implementation Guide

### Convert PowerPoint to HTML with Notes Included

Ideal for web integration, this feature allows you to display presentation notes beneath each slide.

#### Overview

Converting a PowerPoint file into an HTML document ensures compatibility across devices and browsers. This method includes the ability to present notes below slides.

#### Steps

##### Load Your Presentation

Start by loading your PowerPoint file:

```python
import aspose.slides as slides

def convert_to_html_with_notes():
    presentation_path = 'YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/welcome-to-powerpoint.pptx'
    with slides.Presentation(presentation_path) as pres:
        # Further steps will follow here...
```

##### Configure HTML Options

Set up options to include notes at the bottom:

```python
        html_options = slides.export.HtmlOptions()
        layout_options = slides.export.NotesCommentsLayoutingOptions()
        layout_options.notes_position = slides.export.NotesPositions.BOTTOM_FULL
        html_options.slides_layout_options = layout_options
```

##### Save as HTML

Save your presentation with these configurations:

```python
        output_path = 'YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/convert_to_html_with_notes_out.html'
        pres.save(output_path, slides.export.SaveFormat.HTML, html_options)
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure file paths are correctly set to avoid `FileNotFoundError`.
- Verify your license is properly configured if you encounter usage limitations.

### Convert PowerPoint to PDF

Converting presentations into PDF format ensures they can be viewed on any device without additional software.

#### Overview

This process preserves the visual layout and quality of your slides, making them ideal for sharing across platforms.

#### Steps

##### Load Your Presentation

Start by loading the PowerPoint file as shown above.

##### Save as PDF

Use this snippet to save your presentation in PDF format:

```python
def convert_to_pdf():
    presentation_path = 'YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/welcome-to-powerpoint.pptx'
    with slides.Presentation(presentation_path) as pres:
        output_path = 'YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/convert_to_pdf_out.pdf'
        pres.save(output_path, slides.export.SaveFormat.PDF)
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Double-check directory paths to prevent errors.
- If you face any limitations during conversion, ensure your license is active.

## Practical Applications

Here are some scenarios where these conversions can be particularly useful:
1. **Web Integration**: Embed slides in websites or blogs with interactive features like notes using HTML conversions.
2. **Document Sharing**: PDFs provide a consistent viewing experience across platforms, ideal for sharing presentations without format alteration risks.
3. **Archiving**: Convert presentations into static formats for long-term storage and easy retrieval.

## Performance Considerations

To ensure smooth conversions:
- Optimize code by managing resources effectively using context managers (`with` statements) to handle file operations safely.
- Adjust settings in `HtmlOptions` or `PdfOptions` to balance conversion speed and output quality, especially for large presentations.
- Regularly update Aspose.Slides for performance improvements and new features.
