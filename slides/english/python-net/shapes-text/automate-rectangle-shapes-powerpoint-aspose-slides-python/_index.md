# How to Create and Format a Rectangle Shape in PowerPoint using Aspose.Slides for Python
## Introduction
Ever found yourself needing to quickly add custom shapes to your PowerPoint presentations but struggling with the lack of automation? If you're tired of manually formatting rectangles slide by slide, then this tutorial is here to save the day. Leveraging "Aspose.Slides for Python," we'll automate adding and styling a rectangle shape in just a few lines of code. By the end of this guide, you'll master:
- Creating a rectangle shape programmatically
- Applying formatting options like color and line style
- Saving your presentation with ease
Let's dive into how you can transform your slide creation process!
### Prerequisites
Before we start coding, ensure you have the following ready:
- **Python** installed on your machine (version 3.6 or higher is recommended)
- **Aspose.Slides for Python** library, which allows us to manipulate PowerPoint presentations
- Basic understanding of Python programming concepts and familiarity with installing packages using pip
## Setting Up Aspose.Slides for Python
### Installation
To install the Aspose.Slides package, open your terminal or command prompt and run:
```bash
pip install aspose.slides
```
This command fetches and installs the latest version of Aspose.Slides for Python from PyPI.
### License Acquisition
Aspose.Slides is a commercial product, but you can get started with it using a free trial license. Here's how to acquire one:
1. **Free Trial:** Visit [Aspose Free Trial](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/python-net/) and sign up for an evaluation.
2. **Temporary License:** For more extensive testing without limitations, request a temporary license at [Temporary License Page](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
3. **Purchase:** When you're ready to go live, purchase a license through the [Aspose Purchase page](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).
Once acquired, follow the documentation to apply your license in your project.
### Basic Initialization
Here's how you can initialize Aspose.Slides for Python:
```python
import aspose.slides as slides
\# Initialize Presentation class
with slides.Presentation() as pres:
    print("Presentation is ready!")
```
This snippet sets up a new presentation and confirms it's ready to be manipulated.
## Implementation Guide
### Creating the Rectangle Shape
#### Overview
In this section, we'll focus on adding a rectangle shape to a PowerPoint slide using Aspose.Slides for Python.
#### Steps to Create the Shape
1. **Open or create a Presentation:**
   ```python
   import aspose.slides as slides
   
   with slides.Presentation() as pres:
       # We will add our rectangle here
   ```
2. **Access the Slide:**
   Retrieve the first slide where we want to add the shape.
   ```python
   slide = pres.slides[0]
   ```
3. **Add Rectangle Shape:**
   Use the `add_auto_shape` method to create a rectangle on the slide.
   ```python
   shape = slide.shapes.add_auto_shape(slides.ShapeType.RECTANGLE, 50, 150, 150, 50)
   ```
   - Parameters: `ShapeType.RECTANGLE`, x-position (50), y-position (150), width (150), height (50).
### Formatting the Rectangle
#### Overview
Next, we'll apply formatting to our rectangle shape, including fill color and line style.
#### Steps for Formatting
1. **Fill Color:**
   Set a solid fill with a specific color for the rectangle's background.
   ```python
   shape.fill_format.fill_type = slides.FillType.SOLID
   shape.fill_format.solid_fill_color.color = drawing.Color.chocolate
   ```
2. **Line Style:**
   Customize the line of the rectangle, including its color and width.
   ```python
   shape.line_format.fill_format.fill_type = slides.FillType.SOLID
   shape.line_format.fill_format.solid_fill_color.color = drawing.Color.black
   shape.line_format.width = 5
   ```
3. **Save Presentation:**
   Finally, save the presentation to a file.
   ```python
   pres.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/shapes_formatted_rectangle_out.pptx\
