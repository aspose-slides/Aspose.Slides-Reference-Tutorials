# Custom Numbered Bullet Lists in PowerPoint using Aspose.Slides for Python

## Introduction
Are you looking to elevate the visual appeal of your PowerPoint presentations beyond the default bullet points? Whether it's for corporate reports, academic lectures, or business meetings, customizing bullet lists can capture and retain your audience's attention more effectively. With **Aspose.Slides for Python**, you have the flexibility to tailor numbered bullets according to your unique formatting needs.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll demonstrate how to set up custom numbered bullets using Aspose.Slides in PowerPoint with Python. By integrating this feature into your presentations, you can achieve a professional and polished look.

**What Youâ€™ll Learn:**
- Setting up Aspose.Slides for Python
- Creating custom numbered bullet lists
- Configuring bullet settings programmatically
- Optimizing performance and troubleshooting common issues

Let's get started! Ensure you have everything ready to proceed.

## Prerequisites
Before implementing custom numbered bullets with Aspose.Slides for Python, ensure you have:

### Required Libraries:
- **Aspose.Slides for Python**: A robust library for creating and manipulating PowerPoint presentations.

### Environment Setup:
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of Python programming concepts is helpful but not mandatory.

## Setting Up Aspose.Slides for Python
To begin, install the `aspose.slides` library using pip:

```bash
pip install aspose.slides
```

### License Acquisition:
Aspose.Slides is a commercial product offering a free trial for testing its capabilities. You can acquire a temporary license or purchase one for continued use.

- **Free Trial**: Access basic functionality without limitations.
- **Temporary License**: Request on the Aspose website to gain full access temporarily.
- **Purchase**: Consider purchasing a license for long-term projects.

### Basic Initialization:
Once installed, initialize your presentation as follows:

```python
import aspose.slides as slides

with slides.Presentation() as presentation:
    # Your code here...
```

This setup prepares the environment for adding custom numbered bullets to your PowerPoint slides.

## Implementation Guide
Let's dive into creating custom numbered bullet lists. Each step is broken down for clarity and ease of implementation.

### Adding a Rectangle Shape with Text Frames
#### Overview:
First, add a shape that will contain text frames for the bullet points.

```python
# Add a rectangle shape to the first slide
shape = presentation.slides[0].shapes.add_auto_shape(
    slides.ShapeType.RECTANGLE, 200, 200, 400, 200)
```
- **Parameters Explained**: The `add_auto_shape` method takes parameters for shape type (rectangle), position (x and y coordinates), and dimensions (width and height).

### Configuring Text Frames
#### Overview:
Access the text frame of the rectangle to add bullet points.

```python
# Access the text frame of the created autoshape
text_frame = shape.text_frame

# Remove any default existing paragraph if present
text_frame.paragraphs.clear()
```
- **Purpose**: Ensures a clean slate before adding custom bullet points.

### Adding Custom Numbered Bullets
#### Overview:
Add paragraphs with specific bullet settings:

```python
# Add paragraphs with custom numbered bullets
for start_number, bullet_text in [(2, "bullet 2"), (3, "bullet 3"), (7, "bullet 7")]:
    paragraph = slides.Paragraph()
    paragraph.text = bullet_text
    paragraph.paragraph_format.depth = 4
    paragraph.paragraph_format.bullet.numbered_bullet_start_with = start_number
    paragraph.paragraph_format.bullet.type = slides.BulletType.NUMBERED
    text_frame.paragraphs.add(paragraph)
```
- **Configuration**: Each paragraph begins with a specific number, offering flexibility and control over presentation formatting.

### Saving the Presentation
Finally, save your configured presentation:

```python
# Save the presentation\presentation.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/text_set_custom_bullets_number_out.pptx\
