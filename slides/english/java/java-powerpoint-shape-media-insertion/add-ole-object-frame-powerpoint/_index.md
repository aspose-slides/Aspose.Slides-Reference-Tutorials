# Add OLE Object Frame in PowerPoint

## Introduction
Adding an OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) Object Frame in PowerPoint presentations can significantly enhance the visual appeal and functionality of your slides. With Aspose.Slides for Java, this process becomes streamlined and efficient. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the steps required to seamlessly integrate OLE Object Frames into your PowerPoint presentations.
### Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Java Development Environment: Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Slides for Java: Download and install Aspose.Slides for Java from the website [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).
3. Basic Understanding of Java Programming: Familiarize yourself with Java programming concepts and syntax.
## Import Packages
Firstly, you need to import the necessary packages to leverage the functionalities of Aspose.Slides for Java. Here's how you can do it:
```java
import com.aspose.slides.*;

import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
Ensure that your project is configured properly and the Aspose.Slides library is included in your classpath.
## Step 2: Initialize Presentation Object
Create a Presentation object to represent the PowerPoint file you're working with:
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
String outPath = "Your Output Directory";
// Instantiate Presentation class that represents the PPTX
Presentation pres = new Presentation();
```
## Step 3: Access Slide and Load Object
Access the slide where you want to add the OLE Object Frame and load the object file:
```java
ISlide sld = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
// Load a file to stream
FileInputStream fs = new FileInputStream(dataDir + "book1.xlsx");
ByteArrayOutputStream mstream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
byte[] buf = new byte[4096];
while (true) {
    int bytesRead = fs.read(buf, 0, buf.length);
    if (bytesRead <= 0)
        break;
    mstream.write(buf, 0, bytesRead);
}
```
## Step 4: Create Embedded Data Object
Create a data object for embedding the file:
```java
IOleEmbeddedDataInfo dataInfo = new OleEmbeddedDataInfo(mstream.toByteArray(), "xlsx");
```
## Step 5: Add OLE Object Frame
Add an OLE Object Frame shape to the slide:
```java
IOleObjectFrame oleObjectFrame = sld.getShapes().addOleObjectFrame(0, 0, (float)pres.getSlideSize().getSize().getWidth(),
        (float)pres.getSlideSize().getSize().getHeight(), dataInfo);
```
## Step 6: Save Presentation
Save the modified presentation to disk:
```java
pres.save(outPath + "OleEmbed_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
