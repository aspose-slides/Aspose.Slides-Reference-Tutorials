## Introduction
Adding arrow-shaped lines to PowerPoint presentations can enhance visual appeal and aid in conveying information effectively. Aspose.Slides for Java offers a comprehensive solution for Java developers to manipulate PowerPoint presentations programmatically. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of adding arrow-shaped lines to your PowerPoint slides using Aspose.Slides for Java.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Slides for Java library downloaded and added to your project's classpath.
3. Basic knowledge of Java programming.

## Import Packages
To get started, import the necessary packages in your Java class:
```java
import com.aspose.slides.*;

import java.awt.*;
import java.io.File;
```
## Step 1: Set up Document Directory
```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Create directory if it is not already present.
boolean IsExists = new File(dataDir).exists();
if (!IsExists)
	new File(dataDir).mkdirs();
```
## Step 2: Instantiate Presentation
```java
// Instantiate PresentationEx class that represents the PPTX file
Presentation pres = new Presentation();
```
## Step 3: Add Arrow Shaped Line
```java
// Get the first slide
ISlide sld = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
// Add an autoshape of type line
IAutoShape shp = sld.getShapes().addAutoShape(ShapeType.Line, 50, 150, 300, 0);
// Apply some formatting on the line
shp.getLineFormat().setStyle(LineStyle.ThickBetweenThin);
shp.getLineFormat().setWidth(10);
shp.getLineFormat().setDashStyle(LineDashStyle.DashDot);
shp.getLineFormat().setBeginArrowheadLength(LineArrowheadLength.Short);
shp.getLineFormat().setBeginArrowheadStyle(LineArrowheadStyle.Oval);
shp.getLineFormat().setEndArrowheadLength(LineArrowheadLength.Long);
shp.getLineFormat().setEndArrowheadStyle(LineArrowheadStyle.Triangle);
shp.getLineFormat().getFillFormat().setFillType(FillType.Solid);
shp.getLineFormat().getFillFormat().getSolidFillColor().setColor(new Color(PresetColor.Maroon));
```
## Step 4: Save Presentation
```java
// Write the PPTX to Disk
pres.save(dataDir + "LineShape2_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
