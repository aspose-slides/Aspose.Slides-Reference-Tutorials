# Check SmartArt Hidden Property using Java

## Introduction
In the dynamic world of Java programming, manipulating PowerPoint presentations programmatically is a valuable skill. Aspose.Slides for Java is a robust library that empowers developers to create, modify, and manipulate PowerPoint presentations seamlessly. One of the essential tasks in presentation manipulation is checking the hidden property of SmartArt objects. This tutorial will guide you through the process of checking the hidden property of SmartArt using Aspose.Slides for Java.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into this tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
### Java Development Kit (JDK) Installation
Step 1: Download JDK: Visit the Oracle website or your preferred JDK distributor to download the latest version of JDK compatible with your operating system.
Step 2: Install JDK: Follow the installation instructions provided by the JDK distributor for your operating system.
### Aspose.Slides for Java Installation
Step 1: Download Aspose.Slides for Java: Navigate to the download link provided in the documentation (https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/) to download the Aspose.Slides for Java library.
Step 2: Add Aspose.Slides to Your Project: Incorporate the Aspose.Slides for Java library into your Java project by adding the downloaded JAR file to your project's build path.
### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
Step 1: Choose an IDE: Select a Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans.
Step 2: Configure IDE: Configure your IDE to work with the JDK and include Aspose.Slides for Java in your project.

## Import Packages
Before starting the implementation, import the necessary packages to work with Aspose.Slides for Java.
## Step 1: Define Data Directory
```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
This step defines the path where your presentation files will be saved.
## Step 2: Create Presentation Object
```java
Presentation presentation = new Presentation();
```
Here, we create a new instance of the `Presentation` class, which represents a PowerPoint presentation.
## Step 3: Add SmartArt to Slide
```java
ISmartArt smart = presentation.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().addSmartArt(10, 10, 400, 300, SmartArtLayoutType.RadialCycle);
```
This step adds a SmartArt shape to the first slide of the presentation with specified dimensions and layout type.
## Step 4: Add Node to SmartArt
```java
ISmartArtNode node = smart.getAllNodes().addNode();
```
A new node is added to the SmartArt shape created in the previous step.
## Step 5: Check Hidden Property
```java
boolean hidden = node.isHidden(); // Returns true
```
This step checks whether the hidden property of the SmartArt node is true or false.
## Step 6: Perform Actions Based on Hidden Property
```java
if (hidden)
{
    // Do some actions or notifications
}
```
If the hidden property is true, perform specific actions or notifications as required.
## Step 7: Save Presentation
```java
presentation.save(dataDir + "CheckSmartArtHiddenProperty_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
Finally, save the modified presentation to the specified directory with a new filename.

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've learned how to check the hidden property of SmartArt objects in PowerPoint presentations using Aspose.Slides for Java. With this knowledge, you can now manipulate presentations programmatically with ease.
