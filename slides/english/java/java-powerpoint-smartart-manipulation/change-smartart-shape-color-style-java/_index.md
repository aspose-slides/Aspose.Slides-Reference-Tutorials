## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of changing SmartArt shape color styles using Java with Aspose.Slides. SmartArt is a powerful feature in PowerPoint presentations that allows for the creation of visually appealing graphics. By changing the color style of SmartArt shapes, you can enhance the overall design and visual impact of your presentations. We'll break down the process into easy-to-follow steps.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following:
1. Java Development Environment: Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Slides for Java: Download and install Aspose.Slides for Java from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).
3. Basic Knowledge of Java: Familiarity with Java programming language concepts will be helpful.
## Import Packages
Before diving into the code, let's import the necessary packages:
```java
import com.aspose.slides.*;
```
Now, let's break down the code example into step-by-step instructions:
## Step 1: Load the Presentation
First, we need to load the PowerPoint presentation that contains the SmartArt shape:
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Presentation presentation = new Presentation(dataDir + "AccessSmartArtShape.pptx");
```
## Step 2: Traverse Through Shapes
Next, we'll traverse through every shape inside the first slide to identify SmartArt shapes:
```java
for (IShape shape : presentation.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes())
```
## Step 3: Check SmartArt Type
For each shape, we'll check if it's a SmartArt shape:
```java
if (shape instanceof ISmartArt)
```
## Step 4: Change Color Style
If the shape is a SmartArt shape, we'll change its color style:
```java
ISmartArt smart = (ISmartArt) shape;
if (smart.getColorStyle() == SmartArtColorType.ColoredFillAccent1)
{
    smart.setColorStyle(SmartArtColorType.ColorfulAccentColors);
}
```
## Step 5: Save Presentation
Finally, we'll save the modified presentation:
```java
presentation.save(dataDir + "ChangeSmartArtColorStyle_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
## Conclusion
By following these steps, you can easily change SmartArt shape color styles in your PowerPoint presentations using Java with Aspose.Slides. Experiment with different color styles to enhance the visual appeal of your presentations.
