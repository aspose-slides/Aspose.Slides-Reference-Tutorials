```
## Step 2: Traverse through Shapes
Traverse through every shape inside the first slide to find the SmartArt.
```java
for (IShape shape : pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes()) {
    // Check if shape is of SmartArt type
    if (shape instanceof ISmartArt) {
        // Typecast shape to SmartArt
        ISmartArt smart = (ISmartArt) shape;
```
## Step 3: Remove SmartArt Node
Remove the desired node from the SmartArt.
```java
if (smart.getAllNodes().size() > 0) {
    // Accessing SmartArt node at index 0
    ISmartArtNode node = smart.getAllNodes().get_Item(0);
    // Removing the selected node
    smart.getAllNodes().removeNode(node);
}
```
## Step 4: Save Presentation
Save the modified presentation.
```java
pres.save(dataDir + "RemoveSmartArtNode_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
