# Get Chart Image in Java Slides


## Introduction to Get Chart Image in Java Slides

Aspose.Slides for Java is a powerful library that allows you to work with PowerPoint presentations programmatically. With this library, you can create, manipulate, and extract various elements from presentations, including charts. One common requirement is to obtain chart images from slides, and we'll demonstrate how to do just that in this guide.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Aspose.Slides for Java library downloaded and configured in your project. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

Start by creating a Java project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Ensure that you have added the Aspose.Slides for Java library to your project's dependencies.

## Step 2: Initialize the Presentation

To begin, you need to initialize a PowerPoint presentation. In this example, we assume you have a PowerPoint file named "test.pptx" in your document directory.

```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir + "test.pptx");
```

## Step 3: Add a Chart and Get the Image

Next, you can add a chart to a slide and obtain its image. In this example, we'll add a clustered column chart.

```java
try {
    IChart chart = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().addChart(ChartType.ClusteredColumn, 50, 50, 600, 400);
    BufferedImage img = chart.getThumbnail();
    ImageIO.write(img, ".png", new File(dataDir + "image.png"));
} finally {
    if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
}
```

In this code snippet, we create a clustered column chart on the first slide of the presentation and then obtain its thumbnail image. The image is saved as "image.png" in the specified directory.

## Complete Source Code For Get Chart Image in Java Slides

```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir + "test.pptx");
try
{
	IChart chart = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().addChart(ChartType.ClusteredColumn, 50, 50, 600, 400);
	BufferedImage img = chart.getThumbnail();
	ImageIO.write(img, ".png", new File(dataDir + "image.png"));
}
finally
{
	if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
}
```
