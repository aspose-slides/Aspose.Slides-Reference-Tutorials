# Chart Get Range in Java Slides


## Introduction to Chart Get Range in Java Slides

In this step-by-step guide, we will explore how to get the range of a chart in Java Slides using the Aspose.Slides for Java API. We will walk you through the process with detailed source code examples. If you want to access the range of a chart in your Java Slides presentation, follow along to learn how.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Aspose.Slides for Java library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).

## Step 1: Setting Up the Environment

Before we start writing code, ensure that you have the Aspose.Slides for Java library added to your project's classpath. You can download the library from the provided link in the prerequisites section.

## Step 2: Creating a Presentation

To begin, we'll create a presentation using Aspose.Slides. Here's the code to create a presentation object:

```java
// The path to the documents directory.
Presentation pres = new Presentation();
```

## Step 3: Adding a Chart

Next, we'll add a chart to the presentation. In this example, we'll create a clustered column chart. Here's the code for adding the chart:

```java
IChart chart = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().addChart(ChartType.ClusteredColumn, 10, 10, 400, 300);
```

## Step 4: Getting the Range

Now comes the part where we get the range of the chart. We'll use the `getChartData().getRange()` method to accomplish this:

```java
String result = chart.getChartData().getRange();
```

## Step 5: Displaying the Result

Let's print the result to see the chart range:

```java
System.out.println("GetRange result : " + result);
```

## Complete Source Code For Chart Get Range in Java Slides

```java
// The path to the documents directory.
Presentation pres = new Presentation();
try
{
	IChart chart = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().addChart(ChartType.ClusteredColumn, 10, 10, 400, 300);
	String result = chart.getChartData().getRange();
	System.out.println("GetRange result : " + result);
}
finally
{
	if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
}
```

## Conclusion

In this guide, we've learned how to get the range of a chart in Java Slides using the Aspose.Slides for Java API. We covered setting up the environment, creating a presentation, adding a chart, and getting the range. You can now use this knowledge in your Java Slides projects to access chart ranges effectively.
