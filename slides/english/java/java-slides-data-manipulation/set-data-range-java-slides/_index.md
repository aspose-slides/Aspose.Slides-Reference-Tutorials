# Set Data Range in Java Slides


## Introduction to Set Data Range in Java Slides

Presentations often include charts and graphs to convey data effectively. Aspose.Slides for Java simplifies the process of working with charts in PowerPoint presentations. In this tutorial, we will focus on the crucial task of setting a data range for a chart within a presentation.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Environment
- Aspose.Slides for Java API (You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/))
- A PowerPoint presentation with a chart (We will refer to it as `ExistingChart.pptx`)

## Step 1: Getting Started

To begin, let's set up our Java environment and load the existing PowerPoint presentation that contains the chart we want to work with.

```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Instantiate Presentation class that represents PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation(dataDir + "ExistingChart.pptx");
// Access first slide and add chart with default data
ISlide slide = presentation.getSlides().get_Item(0);
IChart chart = (IChart) slide.getShapes().get_Item(0);
```

## Step 2: Setting the Data Range

Now that we have our presentation and chart object, let's set the data range for the chart. The data range specifies which cells from the spreadsheet are used to populate the chart data.

```java
chart.getChartData().setRange("Sheet1!A1:B4");
```

In this example, we are setting the data range to include cells A1 to B4 from "Sheet1" in our spreadsheet.

## Step 3: Saving the Presentation

After setting the data range, it's essential to save our modified presentation.

```java
presentation.save(dataDir + "SetDataRange_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

This line of code saves the presentation to a new file named `SetDataRange_out.pptx` in the specified directory.

// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Instantiate Presentation class that represents PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation(dataDir + "ExistingChart.pptx");
// Access first slideMarker and add chart with default data
ISlide slide = presentation.getSlides().get_Item(0);
IChart chart = (IChart) slide.getShapes().get_Item(0);
chart.getChartData().setRange("Sheet1!A1:B4");
presentation.save(dataDir + "SetDataRange_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
