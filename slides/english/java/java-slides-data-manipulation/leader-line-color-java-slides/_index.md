## Introduction to Leader Line Color in Aspose.Slides for Java

In this tutorial, we will explore how to change the leader line color of a chart in a PowerPoint presentation using Aspose.Slides for Java. Leader lines are used in charts to connect data labels to their corresponding data points. We will use Java code to accomplish this task.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Aspose.Slides for Java API installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).

## Step 1: Load the Presentation

First, you need to load the PowerPoint presentation that contains the chart you want to modify. Replace `presentationName` with the path to your PowerPoint file.

```java
String presentationName = "path/to/your/presentation.pptx";
String outPath = "output/path/output.pptx";
Presentation pres = new Presentation(presentationName);
```

## Step 2: Access the Chart and Data Labels

Next, we will access the chart and data labels within the presentation. In this example, we assume that the chart is located on the first slide.

```java
// Get the chart from the first slide
IChart chart = (IChart)pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().get_Item(0);

// Get series of the chart
IChartSeriesCollection series = chart.getChartData().getSeries();

// Get labels of the first series
IDataLabelCollection labels = series.get_Item(0).getLabels();
```

## Step 3: Change Leader Line Color

Now, we will change the color of all leader lines in the collection to red. You can customize the color as per your requirements.

```java
// Change color of all leader lines in the collection to red
labels.getLeaderLinesFormat().getLine().getFillFormat().getSolidFillColor().setColor(Color.RED);
```

## Step 4: Save the Modified Presentation

Finally, save the presentation with the modified leader line colors to a new file.

```java
// Save the modified presentation
pres.save(outPath, SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

## Complete Source Code For Leader Line Color in Java Slides

```java
        String presentationName = "Your Document Directory";
        String outPath = "Your Output Directory" + "LeaderLinesColor-out.pptx";
        Presentation pres = new Presentation(presentationName);
        try {
            // Get the chart from the first slide
            IChart chart = (IChart)pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().get_Item(0);
            // Get series of the chart
            IChartSeriesCollection series = chart.getChartData().getSeries();
            // Get lebels of the first serie
            IDataLabelCollection labels = series.get_Item(0).getLabels();
            // Change color of all leader lines in the collection
            labels.getLeaderLinesFormat().getLine().getFillFormat().getSolidFillColor().setColor(Color.RED);
            // Save result
            pres.save(outPath, SaveFormat.Pptx);
        } finally {
            if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
        }
```

You can customize the color and other formatting options to meet your specific needs. This can be particularly useful when you want to highlight certain data points in your charts for better visualization.
