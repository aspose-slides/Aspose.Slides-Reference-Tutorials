## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use morph transitions with older PowerPoint versions?**  
A: Aspose.Slides generates PPTX files that are compatible with PowerPoint 2010 and later, which fully support morph transitions.

**Q: How do I control the duration of a morph transition?**  
A: Set the `SlideTransition.Duration` property (in seconds) on the target slide before saving the presentation.

**Q: Is it possible to combine morph with other effects, like zoom?**  
A: Yes. You can apply a morph transition and then use the `Presentation.SlideShowSettings.Zoom` property to set the initial zoom level (e.g., `set zoom levels java`).

**Q: Do I need a license to use these features in development?**  
A: A temporary license is sufficient for testing; a full commercial license is required for production deployments.

**Q: What are the performance considerations for large decks?**  
A: Morph transitions add extra intermediate frames. For very large decks, consider limiting the number of morph slides or increasing the transition duration to reduce processing overhead.
