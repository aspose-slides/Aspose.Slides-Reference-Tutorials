# Metered Licensing in Java Slides


## Introduction to Metered Licensing in Aspose.Slides for Java

Metered licensing allows you to monitor and control your usage of Aspose.Slides for Java API. This guide will walk you through the process of implementing metered licensing in your Java project using Aspose.Slides. 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Aspose.Slides for Java JAR files integrated into your project.
- Public and private keys for metered licensing, which you can obtain from Aspose.

## Implementing Metered Licensing

To use metered licensing in Aspose.Slides for Java, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create an instance of the `Metered` class:

```java
Metered metered = new Metered();
```

### Step 2: Set the metered key using your public and private keys:

```java
try
{
	metered.setMeteredKey("your_public_key", "your_private_key");
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
	// Handle any exceptions
}
```

### Step 3: Get the metered data amount before and after calling the API:

```java
// Get metered data amount before calling API
double amountBefore = Metered.getConsumptionQuantity();

// Display information
System.out.println("Amount Consumed Before: " + amountBefore);

// Call the Aspose.Slides API methods here

// Get metered data amount after calling API
double amountAfter = Metered.getConsumptionQuantity();

// Display information
System.out.println("Amount Consumed After: " + amountAfter);
```
## Complete Source Code
```java
// Create an instance of CAD Metered class
Metered metered = new Metered();
try
{
	// Access the setMeteredKey property and pass public and private keys as parameters
	metered.setMeteredKey("*****", "*****");
	// Get metered data amount before calling API
	double amountbefore = Metered.getConsumptionQuantity();
	// Display information
	System.out.println("Amount Consumed Before: " + amountbefore);
	// Get metered data amount After calling API
	double amountafter = Metered.getConsumptionQuantity();
	// Display information
	System.out.println("Amount Consumed After: " + amountafter);
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
	Logger.getLogger(MeteredLicensing.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex);
}
```
