## Introduction
Creating engaging and visually appealing presentations is a crucial skill in the modern business world. Java developers can leverage Aspose.Slides to enhance their presentations with customized picture bullets in PowerPoint slides. This tutorial will guide you through the process step by step, ensuring you can confidently add picture bullets to your presentations.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA
- Aspose.Slides for Java library
- Basic knowledge of Java programming
- Image file for the bullet picture
To download the Aspose.Slides for Java library, visit the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/). For documentation, check the [documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/).
## Import Packages
First, ensure you have imported the necessary packages for your project. Add the following imports at the beginning of your Java file:
```java
import com.aspose.slides.*;
import javax.imageio.ImageIO;
import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;
```
Let's break down the process into manageable steps.
## Step 1: Set Up Your Project Directory
Create a new directory for your project. This directory will contain your Java file, the Aspose.Slides library, and the image file for the bullet.
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
## Step 2: Initialize the Presentation
Initialize a new instance of the `Presentation` class. This object represents your PowerPoint presentation.
```java
Presentation presentation = new Presentation();
```
## Step 3: Access the First Slide
Access the first slide of the presentation. Slides are zero-indexed, so the first slide is at index 0.
```java
ISlide slide = presentation.getSlides().get_Item(0);
```
## Step 4: Load the Bullet Image
Load the image you want to use for the bullets. This image should be placed in your project directory.
```java
BufferedImage image = ImageIO.read(new File(dataDir + "bullets.png"));
IPPImage ippxImage = presentation.getImages().addImage(image);
```
## Step 5: Add an AutoShape to the Slide
Add an AutoShape to the slide. The shape will contain the text with the custom bullet points.
```java
IAutoShape autoShape = slide.getShapes().addAutoShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, 200, 200, 400, 200);
```
## Step 6: Access the Text Frame
Access the text frame of the AutoShape to manipulate its paragraphs.
```java
ITextFrame textFrame = autoShape.getTextFrame();
```
## Step 7: Remove the Default Paragraph
Remove the default paragraph that is automatically added to the text frame.
```java
textFrame.getParagraphs().removeAt(0);
```
## Step 8: Create a New Paragraph
Create a new paragraph and set its text. This paragraph will contain the custom picture bullets.
```java
Paragraph paragraph = new Paragraph();
paragraph.setText("Welcome to Aspose.Slides");
```
## Step 9: Set Bullet Style and Image
Set the bullet style to use the custom image loaded earlier.
```java
paragraph.getParagraphFormat().getBullet().setType(BulletType.Picture);
paragraph.getParagraphFormat().getBullet().getPicture().setImage(ippxImage);
```
## Step 10: Adjust Bullet Height
Set the height of the bullet to make sure it looks good in the presentation.
```java
paragraph.getParagraphFormat().getBullet().setHeight(100);
```
## Step 11: Add the Paragraph to the Text Frame
Add the newly created paragraph to the text frame of the AutoShape.
```java
textFrame.getParagraphs().add(paragraph);
```
## Step 12: Save the Presentation
Finally, save the presentation as both a PPTX and a PPT file.
```java
presentation.save(dataDir + "ParagraphPictureBulletsPPTX_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
presentation.save(dataDir + "ParagraphPictureBulletsPPT_out.ppt", SaveFormat.Ppt);
```
