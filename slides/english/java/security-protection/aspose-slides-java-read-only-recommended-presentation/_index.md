import com.aspose.slides.Presentation;

public class SetupAsposeSlides {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Presentation pres = new Presentation();
        // Your code logic here
        if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Setting Read-Only Recommended Status

#### Overview
This feature allows you to mark a presentation as read-only recommended, discouraging edits while still allowing access.

#### Implementation Steps
**Step 1: Create a Presentation Instance**
Begin by creating an instance of the `Presentation` class. This serves as your starting point for any modifications.
```java
import com.aspose.slides.Presentation;

public class ReadOnlyRecommended {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize a new presentation
        Presentation pres = new Presentation();
```
**Step 2: Set Read-Only Recommended**
Use the `ProtectionManager` to set the read-only recommended status. This step ensures that your presentation is marked appropriately.
```java
try {
    // Mark the presentation as read-only recommended
    pres.getProtectionManager().setReadOnlyRecommended(true);
```
**Step 3: Save the Presentation**
Finally, save the modified presentation to a file. Ensure you specify the correct path and format.
```java
    // Define output path for the presentation
    String outPptxPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/ReadOnlyRecommended.pptx";

    // Save the modified presentation
    pres.save(outPptxPath, com.aspose.slides.SaveFormat.Pptx);
} finally {
    // Dispose of the Presentation object to free resources
    if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
}
```
**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- **File Path Issues:** Ensure your output path is correctly specified and accessible.
- **Dependency Errors:** Verify that Aspose.Slides dependencies are correctly configured in your project.

## Practical Applications
1. **Corporate Presentations:** Use read-only recommended settings for internal reports to prevent unauthorized modifications.
2. **Educational Materials:** Protect lecture slides shared with students, ensuring content integrity while allowing review.
3. **Marketing Campaigns:** Securely distribute promotional presentations without risking accidental edits by recipients.

## Performance Considerations
- **Optimize Resource Usage:** Dispose of `Presentation` objects promptly after use to free memory.
- **Java Memory Management:** Monitor your application's memory footprint and optimize as necessary, especially when handling large presentations.
- **Best Practices:** Regularly update Aspose.Slides for Java to benefit from performance improvements and bug fixes.
