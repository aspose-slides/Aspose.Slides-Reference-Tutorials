        // Your code here
        pres.dispose();  // Clean up resources
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide
This section breaks down how to implement digital signatures in your presentations.

### Adding a Digital Signature
#### Overview
Adding a digital signature ensures that your presentation has not been altered since signing, providing trust and authenticity.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. Load an Empty Presentation**
Start by creating a new instance of the `Presentation` class.
```java
import com.aspose.slides.Presentation;

Presentation pres = new Presentation();
```

**2. Create a DigitalSignature Object**
Initialize a `DigitalSignature` object with your certificate file and password.
```java
import com.aspose.slides.DigitalSignature;

DigitalSignature signature = new DigitalSignature("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/testsignature1.pfx", "testpass1");
```
- **Certificate Path**: Provide the path to your digital certificate.
- **Password**: Enter the password for accessing the certificate.

**3. Set Comments (Optional)**
You can add comments to describe or annotate the signature.
```java
signature.setComments("Aspose.Slides digital signing test.");
```

**4. Add Signature to Presentation**
Incorporate the digital signature into your presentation's collection of signatures.
```java
pres.getDigitalSignatures().add(signature);
```

**5. Save the Signed Presentation**
Finally, save the presentation with the added digital signature in PPTX format.
```java
import com.aspose.slides.SaveFormat;

pres.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/SomePresentationSigned.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Certificate Issues**: Ensure your certificate file path and password are correct.
- **File Access**: Verify that you have the necessary permissions to access the directories.

## Practical Applications
Digital signatures in PowerPoint presentations can be applied in various scenarios:
1. **Corporate Presentations:** Secure internal documents shared among employees.
2. **Legal Documents:** Sign contracts and agreements where authenticity is crucial.
3. **Educational Content:** Authenticate course materials for students or instructors.
4. **Collaborative Projects:** Ensure that all team members are working with verified files.

## Performance Considerations
When using Aspose.Slides, consider these tips to optimize performance:
- **Efficient Resource Management**: Always dispose of the `Presentation` object after use.
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption, especially when handling large presentations.
- **Best Practices**: Follow Java's garbage collection and resource management guidelines.
