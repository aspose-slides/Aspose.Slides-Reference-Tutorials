## Introduction to Access Open Doc in Java Slides

Aspose.Slides for Java is a powerful API that allows developers to work with PowerPoint presentations programmatically. In this step-by-step guide, we will explore how to access and manipulate Open Document Presentation (ODP) files in Java using Aspose.Slides. We will walk through the process of opening an ODP file and saving it in the PPTX format. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have the knowledge to perform these operations seamlessly in your Java applications.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Environment: Ensure that you have Java JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your system.

2. Aspose.Slides for Java: Download and install Aspose.Slides for Java from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).

3. Sample ODP File: You'll need a sample ODP file to work with. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` in the code with the path to your ODP file.

## Setting Up Your Java Environment

Before using Aspose.Slides for Java, ensure that you have Java JDK installed. You can download it from the Java website and follow the installation instructions.

## Step 1: Loading an ODP File

To work with an ODP file, you first need to load it using Aspose.Slides. Here's the Java code to achieve this:

```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Open the ODP file
Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir + "AccessOpenDoc.odp");
```

In the code above, replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your ODP file.

## Step 2: Converting ODP to PPTX

Now that you've loaded the ODP file, let's proceed to convert it to the PPTX format. This is a common operation when you need to work with PowerPoint files in different formats. Aspose.Slides simplifies this process:

```java
// Saving the ODP presentation to PPTX format
pres.save(dataDir + "AccessOpenDoc_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

The code above saves the loaded ODP presentation as a PPTX file. You can specify the desired output path and format as needed.
