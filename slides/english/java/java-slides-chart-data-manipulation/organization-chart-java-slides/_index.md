# Organization Chart in Java Slides


## Introduction to Creating an Organization Chart in Java Slides using Aspose.Slides

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to create an organization chart in Java Slides using the Aspose.Slides for Java API. An organization chart is a visual representation of the hierarchical structure of an organization, typically used to illustrate the relationships and hierarchy among employees or departments.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java) library installed in your Java project.
- A Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

## Step 1: Set up Your Java Project

1. Create a new Java project in your preferred IDE.
2. Add the Aspose.Slides for Java library to your project. You can download the library from the [Aspose website](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java) and include it as a dependency.

## Step 2: Import the Required Libraries
In your Java class, import the necessary libraries to work with Aspose.Slides:

```java
import com.aspose.slides.*;
```

## Step 3: Create an Organization Chart

Now, let's create an organization chart using Aspose.Slides. We'll follow these steps:

1. Specify the path to your document directory.
2. Load an existing PowerPoint presentation or create a new one.
3. Add an organization chart shape to a slide.
4. Save the presentation with the organization chart.

Here's the code to accomplish this:

```java
// Specify the path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Load an existing presentation or create a new one.
Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir + "test.pptx");
try {
    // Add an organization chart shape to the first slide.
    ISmartArt smartArt = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().addSmartArt(0, 0, 400, 400, SmartArtLayoutType.PictureOrganizationChart);

    // Save the presentation with the organization chart.
    pres.save(dataDir + "OrganizationChart.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
} finally {
    if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
}
```

Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your document directory and `"test.pptx"` with the name of your input PowerPoint presentation.

## Step 4: Run the Code

Now that you've added the code to create an organization chart, run your Java application. Make sure the Aspose.Slides library is correctly added to your project, and the necessary dependencies are resolved.

	pres.save(dataDir + "OrganizationChart.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
}
