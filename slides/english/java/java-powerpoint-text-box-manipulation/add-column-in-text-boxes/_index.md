# Add Column in Text Boxes with Aspose.Slides for Java

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will explore how to enhance text boxes by adding columns using Aspose.Slides for Java. Aspose.Slides is a powerful Java library that allows developers to create, manipulate, and convert PowerPoint presentations programmatically without requiring Microsoft Office. Adding columns to text boxes can greatly improve the readability and organization of content within slides, making your presentations more engaging and professional.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of Java programming.
- JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your machine.
- Aspose.Slides for Java library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).

## Import Packages
To get started, you need to import the necessary Aspose.Slides classes into your Java file. Here's how you can do it:
```java
import com.aspose.slides.*;
```
## Step 1: Initialize Presentation and Slide
First, create a new PowerPoint presentation and initialize the first slide.
```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Presentation presentation = new Presentation();
try {
    // Get the first slide of the presentation
    ISlide slide = presentation.getSlides().get_Item(0);
```
## Step 2: Add AutoShape (Rectangle)
Next, add an AutoShape of Rectangle type to the slide.
```java
    // Add an AutoShape of Rectangle type
    IAutoShape aShape = slide.getShapes().addAutoShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, 100, 100, 300, 300);
```
## Step 3: Add TextFrame to the Rectangle
Now, add a TextFrame to the Rectangle AutoShape and set its initial text.
```java
    // Add TextFrame to the Rectangle
    aShape.addTextFrame("All these columns are limited to be within a single text container -- " +
            "you can add or delete text and the new or remaining text automatically adjusts " +
            "itself to flow within the container. You cannot have text flow from one container " +
            "to other though -- we told you PowerPoint's column options for text are limited!");
```
## Step 4: Set Number of Columns
Specify the number of columns within the TextFrame.
```java
    // Get text format of TextFrame
    ITextFrameFormat format = aShape.getTextFrame().getTextFrameFormat();
    // Specify number of columns in TextFrame
    format.setColumnCount(3);
```
## Step 5: Adjust Column Spacing
Set the spacing between columns in the TextFrame.
```java
    // Specify spacing between columns
    format.setColumnSpacing(10);
```
## Step 6: Save the Presentation
Finally, save the modified presentation to a PowerPoint file.
```java
    // Save created presentation
    presentation.save(dataDir + "ColumnCount.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
} finally {
    if (presentation != null) presentation.dispose();
}
```
