```java
try {
    ISlide slide = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
    for (IShape shape : slide.getShapes()) {
        if (shape.getPlaceholder() != null && shape instanceof AutoShape) {
            // Process only AutoShape placeholders
            String text = "";
            if (shape.getPlaceholder().getType() == PlaceholderType.CenteredTitle) {
                text = "Click to add custom title";
            } else if (shape.getPlaceholder().getType() == PlaceholderType.Subtitle) {
                text = "Click to add custom subtitle";
            }
            
            // Set the custom prompt text
            ((IAutoShape) shape).getTextFrame().setText(text);
            
            // Print the placeholder text for verification
            System.out.println(String.format("Placeholder with text: %s", text));
        }
    }
    
    // Save the modified presentation
    pres.save(dataDir + "Placeholders_PromptText.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
} finally {
    if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
