# Highlight Text using Regex in Java PowerPoint

## Introduction
In the realm of Java-based development for creating and manipulating PowerPoint presentations, Aspose.Slides for Java stands out as a robust solution. This tutorial focuses on leveraging Aspose.Slides to highlight text using regular expressions (regex) within PowerPoint presentations. By the end of this guide, you will grasp how to implement regex patterns to highlight specific text in slides, enhancing both functionality and visual clarity.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into this tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of Java programming.
- JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your system.
- IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
- Aspose.Slides for Java library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).

## Import Packages
To begin, you need to import the necessary packages from Aspose.Slides and Java standard libraries. Include these at the beginning of your Java class or file:
```java
import com.aspose.slides.AutoShape;
import com.aspose.slides.Presentation;
import com.aspose.slides.SaveFormat;
import com.aspose.slides.TextHighlightingOptions;
import java.awt.*;
```
## Step 1: Load the Presentation
Firstly, load the PowerPoint presentation where you want to highlight text. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` and `"SomePresentation.pptx"` with your actual file path and name.
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Presentation presentation = new Presentation(dataDir + "SomePresentation.pptx");
```
## Step 2: Define Highlighting Options
Next, define the text highlighting options. You can customize aspects like color and pattern matching. Here, we set the color to blue and specify a regex pattern to highlight words with 10 or more characters (`\\b[^\\s]{10,}\\b`).
```java
TextHighlightingOptions options = new TextHighlightingOptions();
options.setForegroundColor(Color.BLUE);
```
## Step 3: Apply Regex Highlighting
Apply the regex highlighting to the desired text within the presentation. Adjust the slide index (`0`) and shape index (`0`) based on your specific slide and shape where text needs highlighting.
```java
((AutoShape) presentation.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().get_Item(0))
    .getTextFrame().highlightRegex("\\b[^\\s]{10,}\\b", options);
```
## Step 4: Save the Modified Presentation
Save the modified presentation to a new file. Ensure to specify the output file path (`SomePresentation-out.pptx`) where the highlighted version will be stored.
```java
presentation.save(dataDir + "SomePresentation-out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

## Conclusion
In conclusion, utilizing Aspose.Slides for Java empowers developers to dynamically enhance PowerPoint presentations with regex-based text highlighting. This tutorial has equipped you with the foundational knowledge to seamlessly integrate this functionality into your Java applications, thereby elevating the interactivity and visual appeal of your presentations.
