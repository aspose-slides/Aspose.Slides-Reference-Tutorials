### What are Media Controls?

Before we dive into the technical details, let's understand what media controls are and why they matter.

With media controls, you can seamlessly integrate the video, play it at the right moment, and even control playback options like pause, play, and volume. This level of interactivity elevates your presentation to a whole new level.
