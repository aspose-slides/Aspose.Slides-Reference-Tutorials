## Introduction to Update Presentation Properties in Java Slides

In today's digital age, presentations play a crucial role in conveying information effectively. Whether it's a business proposal, an educational lecture, or a sales pitch, presentations are used to communicate ideas, data, and concepts. In the world of Java programming, you might find yourself needing to manipulate presentation properties to enhance the quality and impact of your slides. In this comprehensive guide, we will walk you through the process of updating presentation properties in Java slides using Aspose.Slides for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code and the step-by-step guide, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Environment: You should have Java installed on your system.

- Aspose.Slides for Java: Download and install Aspose.Slides for Java from the website. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Project

To get started, create a new Java project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Once your project is set up, ensure that you have added the Aspose.Slides for Java library to your project's dependencies.

## Step 2: Reading Presentation Information

In this step, we will read the information of the presentation file. This is done using the following code snippet:

```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// read the info of presentation 
IPresentationInfo info = PresentationFactory.getInstance().getPresentationInfo(dataDir + "ModifyBuiltinProperties1.pptx");
```

Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your presentation file.

## Step 3: Obtaining Current Properties

After reading the presentation information, we need to obtain the current properties. This is crucial because we want to make changes to these properties. Use the following code to retrieve the current properties:

```java
// obtain the current properties 
IDocumentProperties props = info.readDocumentProperties();
```

## Step 4: Setting New Values

Now that we have the current properties, we can set new values for specific fields. In this example, we will set the author and title fields to new values:

```java
// set the new values of Author and Title fields 
props.setAuthor("New Author");
props.setTitle("New Title");
```

You can customize this step to update other document properties as needed.

## Step 5: Updating the Presentation

With the new property values set, it's time to update the presentation with these new values. This ensures that the changes are saved in the presentation file. Use the following code:

```java
// update the presentation with new values 
info.updateDocumentProperties(props);
info.writeBindedPresentation(dataDir + "ModifyBuiltinProperties1.pptx");
```

This code will write the modified properties back to the presentation file.

props.setTitle("New Title");
// update the presentation with a new values

```
