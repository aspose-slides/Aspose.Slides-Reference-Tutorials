### Environment Setup Requirements
- JDK 16 or later: Ensure your environment has a compatible version of the Java Development Kit.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Java programming and IDEs (such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
- Familiarity with project management tools like Maven or Gradle is beneficial but not necessary.

## Setting Up Aspose.Slides for Java

To integrate Aspose.Slides into your Java project, follow these installation instructions:

### Maven
Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-slides</artifactId>
    <version>25.4</version>
    <classifier>jdk16</classifier>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle
Include this in your `build.gradle` file:
```gradle
implementation group: 'com.aspose', name: 'aspose-slides', version: '25.4', classifier: 'jdk16'
```

### Direct Download
Alternatively, download the latest version directly from [Aspose.Slides for Java releases](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).

### License Acquisition Steps
- **Free Trial**: Begin by downloading a free trial to test Aspose.Slides features.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for extended testing without limitations.
- **Purchase**: For full access, purchase a commercial license.

Once the library is included in your project, initialize Aspose.Slides as follows:
```java
import com.aspose.slides.PresentationFactory;
// Initialize Presentation Factory
PresentationFactory presentationFactory = PresentationFactory.getInstance();
```

## Implementation Guide

Now that you have set up Aspose.Slides for Java, let's explore how to update and read presentation properties.

### Updating Presentation Properties
This feature allows you to programmatically change the author and title metadata of a PowerPoint file.

#### Overview
Updating document properties is crucial when generating consistent reports or presentations. This section demonstrates how to accomplish this using Aspose.Slides for Java.

##### Step 1: Obtain Presentation Information
Start by obtaining information about your presentation file:
```java
String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
IPresentationInfo info = PresentationFactory.getInstance().getPresentationInfo(dataDir + "/ModifyBuiltinProperties1.pptx");
```

##### Step 2: Read and Update Document Properties
Access the current properties, update them, and then save the changes:
```java
IDocumentProperties props = info.readDocumentProperties();
props.setAuthor("New Author"); // Set your desired author name
props.setTitle("New Title");   // Set your desired title
// Apply updates to the presentation file
info.updateDocumentProperties(props);
info.writeBindedPresentation(dataDir + "/ModifyBuiltinProperties1.pptx");
```

### Reading Presentation Properties
Understanding how to retrieve and display existing properties is crucial for auditing or processing documents.

#### Overview
This feature allows you to access and inspect metadata within a PowerPoint presentation, providing insights into the document's origins and content structure.

##### Step 1: Obtain Presentation Information
Similar to updating properties, start by accessing your file:
```java
String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
IPresentationInfo info = PresentationFactory.getInstance().getPresentationInfo(dataDir + "/ModifyBuiltinProperties1.pptx");
```

##### Step 2: Read Document Properties
Retrieve and display the author and title properties for verification or processing needs:
```java
IDocumentProperties props = info.readDocumentProperties();
String author = props.getAuthor(); // Retrieve author name
String title = props.getTitle();   // Retrieve document title
// Output can be logged or displayed as required (e.g., in a UI)
```

## Practical Applications
Aspose.Slides for Java offers versatile solutions for managing presentation properties. Here are some real-world applications:

1. **Automated Reporting**: Automatically update metadata when generating batch reports.
2. **Document Management Systems**: Integrate with systems to maintain consistent document metadata.
3. **Branding Consistency**: Ensure all company presentations carry uniform branding elements.
4. **Data Auditing**: Use property reading features for auditing and validating presentation sources.

## Performance Considerations
When working with Aspose.Slides, consider these performance tips:

- Optimize memory usage by managing resource allocation, especially when processing large files.
- Utilize best practices in Java memory management to prevent leaks and enhance application responsiveness.
- Profile your application to identify bottlenecks related to presentation handling.
