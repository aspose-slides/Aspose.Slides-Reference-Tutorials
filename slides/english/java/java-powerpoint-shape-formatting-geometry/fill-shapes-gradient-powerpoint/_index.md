# Fill Shapes with Gradient in PowerPoint

## Introduction
Creating visually appealing PowerPoint presentations is crucial for captivating your audience. One of the effective ways to enhance your slides is by filling shapes with gradients. This tutorial will guide you through the process of using Aspose.Slides for Java to fill shapes with gradients in PowerPoint. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, you'll find this guide helpful and easy to follow. Let's dive into the world of gradients and see how they can transform your presentations.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following:
- Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have JDK installed. You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
- Aspose.Slides for Java: Download the latest version from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse will make your coding experience smoother.
- Basic Knowledge of Java: Familiarity with Java programming is essential.
## Import Packages
To start with Aspose.Slides, you need to import the necessary packages. Ensure you have added Aspose.Slides for Java to your project’s dependencies.
```java
import com.aspose.slides.*;

import java.awt.*;
import java.io.File;
```
## Step 1: Setting Up Your Project Directory
First, you need a directory to save your PowerPoint file.
```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Create directory if it is not already present.
boolean isExists = new File(dataDir).exists();
if (!isExists)
	new File(dataDir).mkdirs();
```
This step ensures that the directory where you intend to save your PowerPoint file exists. If it doesn't, the code will create it for you.
## Step 2: Instantiate Presentation Class
Next, create an instance of the Presentation class which represents a PowerPoint file.
```java
// Instantiate Presentation class that represents the PPTX
Presentation pres = new Presentation();
```
This object will serve as the container for your slides and shapes.
## Step 3: Access the First Slide
After creating the presentation instance, you need to access the first slide where you’ll add the shapes.
```java
// Get the first slide
ISlide sld = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
```
This code fetches the first slide from your presentation where you can start adding shapes.
## Step 4: Add an Ellipse Shape
Now, add an ellipse shape to the slide.
```java
// Add autoshape of ellipse type
IShape shp = sld.getShapes().addAutoShape(ShapeType.Ellipse, 50, 150, 75, 150);
```
Here, an ellipse is added at a specified position with defined dimensions.
## Step 5: Apply Gradient Fill to the Shape
To make the shape visually appealing, apply gradient fill to it.
```java
// Apply some gradient formatting to ellipse shape
shp.getFillFormat().setFillType(FillType.Gradient);
shp.getFillFormat().getGradientFormat().setGradientShape(GradientShape.Linear);
```
This code sets the fill type of the shape to gradient and specifies the gradient shape as linear.
## Step 6: Set Gradient Direction
Define the direction of the gradient for a better visual effect.
```java
// Set the Gradient Direction
shp.getFillFormat().getGradientFormat().setGradientDirection(GradientDirection.FromCorner2);
```
This sets the gradient to flow from one corner to another, enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the shape.
## Step 7: Add Gradient Stops
Gradient stops define the colors and positions within the gradient.
```java
// Add two Gradient Stops
shp.getFillFormat().getGradientFormat().getGradientStops().add((float) 1.0, new Color(PresetColor.Purple));
shp.getFillFormat().getGradientFormat().getGradientStops().add((float) 0, Color.RED);
```
This code adds two gradient stops, blending from purple to red.
## Step 8: Save the Presentation
Finally, save your presentation to the specified directory.
```java
// Write the PPTX file to disk
pres.save(dataDir + "EllipseShpGrad_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
This line of code saves your presentation with the applied gradient effect.
## Step 9: Dispose of the Presentation Object
Always ensure to release resources by disposing of the presentation object.
```java
finally {
	if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
}
```
This ensures that all resources are properly cleaned up.
