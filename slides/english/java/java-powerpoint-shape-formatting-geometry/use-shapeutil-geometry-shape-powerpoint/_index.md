# Use ShapeUtil for Geometry Shape in PowerPoint

## Introduction
Creating visually appealing PowerPoint presentations often requires more than just using standard shapes and text. Imagine being able to add customized shapes and text paths directly into your slides, enhancing the visual impact of your presentation. Using Aspose.Slides for Java, you can achieve this with ease. This tutorial will guide you through the process of using the `ShapeUtil` class to create geometry shapes in PowerPoint presentations. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, this step-by-step guide will help you leverage the power of Aspose.Slides for Java to create stunning, custom-shaped content.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, there are a few things you'll need:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have JDK 8 or higher installed on your machine.
2. Aspose.Slides for Java: Download the latest version from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).
3. Development Environment: Use any Java IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.
4. Temporary License: Obtain a free temporary license from [Aspose's temporary license page](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) to unlock the full functionality of Aspose.Slides for Java.
## Import Packages
To get started, you need to import the necessary packages for working with Aspose.Slides and Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit):
```java
import com.aspose.slides.*;

import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.Shape;
import java.awt.font.GlyphVector;
import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;
```
## Step 1: Setting Up Your Project
First, set up your Java project and add Aspose.Slides for Java to your project's dependencies. You can do this by adding the JAR files directly or by using a build tool like Maven or Gradle.
## Step 2: Create a New Presentation
Start by creating a new PowerPoint presentation object. This object will be the canvas where you'll add your custom shapes.
```java
Presentation pres = new Presentation();
```
## Step 3: Add a Rectangle Shape
Next, add a basic rectangle shape to the first slide of the presentation. This shape will be modified later to include a custom geometry path.
```java
GeometryShape shape = (GeometryShape) pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().addAutoShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, 100, 100, 300, 100);
```
## Step 4: Retrieve and Modify the Geometry Path
Retrieve the geometry path of the rectangle shape and modify its fill mode to `None`. This step is crucial as it allows you to combine this path with another custom geometry path.
```java
IGeometryPath originalPath = shape.getGeometryPaths()[0];
originalPath.setFillMode(PathFillModeType.None);
```
## Step 5: Create a Custom Geometry Path from Text
Now, create a custom geometry path based on text. This involves converting a text string into a graphical path and then converting that path into a geometry path.
```java
Shape graphicsPath = generateShapeFromText(new java.awt.Font("Arial", Font.PLAIN, 40), "Text in shape");
IGeometryPath textPath = ShapeUtil.graphicsPathToGeometryPath(graphicsPath);
textPath.setFillMode(PathFillModeType.Normal);
```
## Step 6: Combine the Geometry Paths
Combine the original geometry path with the new text-based geometry path and set this combination to the shape.
```java
shape.setGeometryPaths(new IGeometryPath[]{originalPath, textPath});
```
## Step 7: Save the Presentation
Finally, save the modified presentation to a file. This will output a PowerPoint file with your custom shapes.
```java
String resultPath = "GeometryShapeUsingShapeUtil.pptx";
pres.save(resultPath, SaveFormat.Pptx);
pres.dispose();
```
## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've just created a custom geometry shape in a PowerPoint presentation using Aspose.Slides for Java. This tutorial walked you through each step, from setting up your project to generating and combining geometry paths. By mastering these techniques, you can add unique and eye-catching elements to your presentations, making them stand out.
