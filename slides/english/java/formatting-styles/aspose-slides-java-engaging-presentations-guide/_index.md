Transform your presentation creation skills by getting started with the prerequisites outlined below.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin creating and customizing presentations, ensure you have the necessary tools:

### Required Libraries and Versions

To use **Aspose.Slides for Java**, include it in your project via Maven or Gradle. Here are the configurations:

**Maven:**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-slides</artifactId>
    <version>25.4</version>
    <classifier>jdk16</classifier>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle:**
```gradle
implementation group: 'com.aspose', name: 'aspose-slides', version: '25.4', classifier: 'jdk16'
```

Alternatively, download the latest version from [Aspose.Slides for Java releases](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).

### Environment Setup

Ensure you have a working JDK 16 environment and an IDE or text editor that supports Java development.

### Knowledge Prerequisites

A basic understanding of Java programming is essential, along with familiarity with presentation software like Microsoft PowerPoint.

## Setting Up Aspose.Slides for Java

To start using **Aspose.Slides**, follow these steps:
1. **Installation**: Add the Aspose.Slides dependency to your project management tool (Maven or Gradle) as shown above.
2. **License Acquisition**:
   - Start with a free trial by downloading from [Aspose.Slides for Java releases](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).
   - For extended use, consider purchasing a license or requesting a temporary one via [Aspose's Purchase Page](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

Once installed and licensed, initialize the library in your Java application:
```java
import com.aspose.slides.Presentation;

public class AsposeSlidesSetup {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize a new Presentation object.
        Presentation pres = new Presentation();
        
        // Your code here
        
        // Always dispose resources to free up memory
        if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
    }
}
```
This setup prepares you for creating and manipulating presentations.

## Implementation Guide

### Feature 1: Setting Up a New Presentation

#### Overview
The foundation of an impactful presentation is its structure. This section demonstrates how to initialize a new presentation and add slides using Aspose.Slides for Java.

**Step-by-Step Instructions**

**Add a Slide to the Presentation**
```java
import com.aspose.slides.ISlide;
import com.aspose.slides.SlideLayoutType;

ISlide slide = pres.getSlides().addEmptySlide(pres.getLayoutSlides().getByType(SlideLayoutType.Blank));
```
Here, you add an empty slide using a blank layout.

**Save the Presentation**
```java
pres.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/SetupPresentationResult.pptx", com.aspose.slides.SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
Finally, save your presentation to disk. Always ensure you dispose of resources properly:
```java
if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
```

### Feature 2: Adding a Chart to Slide

#### Overview
Charts are crucial for visual data representation in presentations. This section guides you through adding a clustered column chart.

**Step-by-Step Instructions**

**Create a New Presentation**
```java
Presentation pres = new Presentation();
```
Begin by creating a new presentation instance.

**Access the First Slide**
```java
import com.aspose.slides.ISlide;

ISlide slide = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
```
Assuming your presentation has at least one slide, access it here.

**Add a Chart to the Slide**
```java
import com.aspose.slides.IChart;
import com.aspose.slides.ChartType;

IChart chart = slide.getShapes().addChart(ChartType.ClusteredColumn, 50, 50, 450, 300);
```
This code snippet adds a clustered column chart at position (50, 50) with dimensions 450x300.

**Save the Presentation**
```java
pres.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/AddChartToSlideResult.pptx", com.aspose.slides.SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
Save your updated presentation and dispose of resources:
```java
if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
```

### Feature 3: Setting Display Unit on Chart Axis

#### Overview
Customizing the axis display unit can enhance readability. Hereâ€™s how to set it for a chart's vertical axis.

**Step-by-Step Instructions**

**Add a Chart to Slide**
```java
IChart chart = slide.getShapes().addChart(ChartType.ClusteredColumn, 50, 50, 450, 300);
```
This step is similar to the previous feature but now focuses on customization.

**Set Vertical Axis Display Unit**
```java
import com.aspose.slides.DisplayUnitType;

chart.getAxes().getVerticalAxis().setDisplayUnit(DisplayUnitType.Millions);
```
Change the axis display unit to millions for better comprehension of large data sets.

**Save and Dispose**
```java
pres.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/SetDisplayUnitOnAxisResult.pptx", com.aspose.slides.SaveFormat.Pptx);
if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Null Pointer Exceptions**: Ensure slides exist before accessing them.
- **File Save Errors**: Verify the output directory path is correct and writable.

## Practical Applications
Aspose.Slides for Java can be applied in various real-world scenarios:
