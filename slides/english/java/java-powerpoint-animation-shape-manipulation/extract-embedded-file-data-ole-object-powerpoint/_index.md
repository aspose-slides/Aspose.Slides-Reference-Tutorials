# Extract Embedded File Data from OLE Object in PowerPoint


## Introduction
In the realm of Java programming, extracting embedded file data from OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) objects within PowerPoint presentations is a task that often arises, particularly in document management or data extraction applications. Aspose.Slides for Java offers a robust solution for handling PowerPoint presentations programmatically. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to extract embedded file data from OLE objects using Aspose.Slides for Java.
## Prerequisites
Before we delve into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Basic knowledge of Java programming.
- JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your system.
- Aspose.Slides for Java library downloaded and referenced in your project.

## Import Packages
Firstly, ensure you import the necessary packages in your Java project to utilize the functionality provided by Aspose.Slides for Java.
```java
import com.aspose.slides.IShape;
import com.aspose.slides.ISlide;
import com.aspose.slides.OleObjectFrame;
import com.aspose.slides.Presentation;

import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
```

Now, let's break down the process into multiple steps:
## Step 1: Provide Document Directory Path
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path to the directory containing your PowerPoint presentation.
## Step 2: Specify PowerPoint File Name
```java
String pptxFileName = dataDir + "TestOlePresentation.pptx";
```
Ensure to replace `"TestOlePresentation.pptx"` with the name of your PowerPoint presentation file.
## Step 3: Load Presentation
```java
Presentation pres = new Presentation(pptxFileName);
```
This line initializes a new instance of the `Presentation` class, loading the specified PowerPoint presentation file.
## Step 4: Iterate Through Slides and Shapes
```java
for (ISlide sld : pres.getSlides()) {
    for (IShape shape : sld.getShapes()) {
```
Here, we iterate through each slide and shape within the presentation.
## Step 5: Check for OLE Object
```java
if (shape instanceof OleObjectFrame) {
```
This condition checks if the shape is an OLE object.
## Step 6: Extract Embedded File Data
```java
OleObjectFrame oleFrame = (OleObjectFrame) shape;
byte[] data = oleFrame.getEmbeddedData().getEmbeddedFileData();
```
If the shape is an OLE object, we extract its embedded file data.
## Step 7: Determine File Extension
```java
String fileExtention = oleFrame.getEmbeddedData().getEmbeddedFileExtension();
```
This line retrieves the file extension of the extracted embedded file.
## Step 8: Save Extracted File
```java
String extractedPath = dataDir + "ExtractedObject_out" + objectnum + fileExtention;
FileOutputStream fs = new FileOutputStream(extractedPath);
fs.write(data, 0, data.length);
```
Finally, we save the extracted file data to the specified directory.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've learned how to utilize Aspose.Slides for Java to extract embedded file data from OLE objects within PowerPoint presentations. By following the provided steps, you can seamlessly integrate this functionality into your Java applications, enhancing document management capabilities.
