# Embed Fonts in HTML using Aspose.Slides for Java

## Introduction
Aspose.Slides for Java is a powerful tool for Java developers seeking to manipulate PowerPoint presentations programmatically. In this tutorial, we'll delve into the process of embedding fonts in HTML using Aspose.Slides for Java. By embedding fonts, you ensure that your presentations maintain their intended appearance across different platforms and devices, even if the required fonts are not installed locally.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have JDK installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Slides for Java: Download and install Aspose.Slides for Java from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).
3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Choose your preferred IDE for Java development, such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

## Import Packages
First, you need to import the necessary packages to begin embedding fonts in HTML using Aspose.Slides for Java.
```java
import com.aspose.slides.*;
```
## Step 1: Define Document and Output Directories
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
String outPath = "Your Output Directory";
```
Ensure you replace `"Your Document Directory"` and `"Your Output Directory"` with the paths to your input PowerPoint presentation and desired output directory, respectively.
## Step 2: Load the Presentation
```java
Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir + "Presentation.pptx");
```
This step loads the PowerPoint presentation into memory, allowing you to perform various operations on it.
## Step 3: Exclude Default Fonts
```java
String[] fontNameExcludeList = { "Arial" };
```
Specify the fonts you want to exclude from embedding. In this example, we exclude Arial.
## Step 4: Embed Fonts in HTML
```java
EmbedAllFontsHtmlController embedFontsController = new EmbedAllFontsHtmlController(fontNameExcludeList);
HtmlOptions htmlOptionsEmbed = new HtmlOptions();
htmlOptionsEmbed.setHtmlFormatter(HtmlFormatter.createCustomFormatter(embedFontsController));
pres.save(outPath + "pres.html", SaveFormat.Html, htmlOptionsEmbed);
```
In this step, we create an instance of `EmbedAllFontsHtmlController` to embed all fonts except those specified in the exclusion list. Then, we define `HtmlOptions` and set a custom HTML formatter to embed the fonts. Finally, we save the presentation as HTML with embedded fonts.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we explored how to embed fonts in HTML using Aspose.Slides for Java. By following the provided steps, you can ensure that your presentations maintain consistent typography across different platforms and devices, enhancing the overall viewing experience.
