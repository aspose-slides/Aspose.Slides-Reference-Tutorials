import com.aspose.slides.Presentation;
// Include Aspose.Slides for Java library
```

Now, let's delve into a step-by-step guide on how to leverage Aspose.Slides for Java to manipulate text style data in a PowerPoint presentation:
## Step 1: Load the Presentation
```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Load the presentation
Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir + "Presentation1.pptx");
```
## Step 2: Access Text Style Data
```java
try {
    // Access the first shape in the presentation
    IAutoShape shape = (IAutoShape) pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().get_Item(0);
    // Retrieve the effective text style data
    ITextStyleEffectiveData effectiveTextStyle = shape.getTextFrame().getTextFrameFormat().getTextStyle().getEffective();
```
## Step 3: Iterate Through Style Levels
```java
    // Iterate through different style levels
    for (int i = 0; i <= 8; i++) {
        // Retrieve effective paragraph formatting for each style level
        IParagraphFormatEffectiveData effectiveStyleLevel = effectiveTextStyle.getLevel(i);
        // Print out the effective paragraph formatting details
        System.out.println("= Effective paragraph formatting for style level #" + i + " =");
        System.out.println("Depth: " + effectiveStyleLevel.getDepth());
        System.out.println("Indent: " + effectiveStyleLevel.getIndent());
        System.out.println("Alignment: " + effectiveStyleLevel.getAlignment());
        System.out.println("Font alignment: " + effectiveStyleLevel.getFontAlignment());
    }
} finally {
    // Dispose of the presentation object
    if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
}
```
