# Manage Font Family in Java PowerPoint

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll explore how to manage font family in Java PowerPoint presentations using Aspose.Slides for Java. Fonts play a crucial role in the visual appeal and readability of your slides, so it's essential to know how to manipulate them effectively.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have JDK installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Slides for Java: Download and install Aspose.Slides for Java from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).
3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Use any Java-compatible IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.

## Import Packages
First, let's import the necessary packages to work with Aspose.Slides for Java:
```java
import com.aspose.slides.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.io.File;
```
## Step 1: Create a Presentation Object
Instantiate the `Presentation` class to begin working with a PowerPoint presentation:
```java
Presentation pres = new Presentation();
```
## Step 2: Add a Slide and AutoShape
Now, let's add a slide and an AutoShape (in this case, a Rectangle) to the presentation:
```java
ISlide sld = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);
IAutoShape ashp = sld.getShapes().addAutoShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, 50, 50, 200, 50);
```
## Step 3: Set Font Properties
We'll set various font properties like font type, style, size, color, etc. for the text within the AutoShape:
```java
ITextFrame tf = ashp.getTextFrame();
tf.setText("Aspose TextBox");
IPortion port = tf.getParagraphs().get_Item(0).getPortions().get_Item(0);
port.getPortionFormat().setLatinFont(new FontData("Times New Roman"));
port.getPortionFormat().setFontBold(NullableBool.True);
port.getPortionFormat().setFontItalic(NullableBool.True);
port.getPortionFormat().setFontUnderline(TextUnderlineType.Single);
port.getPortionFormat().setFontHeight(25);
port.getPortionFormat().getFillFormat().setFillType(FillType.Solid);
port.getPortionFormat().getFillFormat().getSolidFillColor().setColor(Color.BLUE);
```
## Step 4: Save the Presentation
Finally, save the modified presentation to disk:
```java
pres.save(dataDir + "pptxFont_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
