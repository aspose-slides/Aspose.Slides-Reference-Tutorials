# Add Embedded Fonts in PowerPoint using Java

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of adding embedded fonts to PowerPoint presentations using Java, specifically leveraging Aspose.Slides for Java. Embedded fonts ensure that your presentation appears consistent across different devices, even if the original font isn't available. Let's dive into the steps:
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following:
1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Slides for Java Library: Download and install the Aspose.Slides for Java library. You can get it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).

## Import Packages
Import the necessary packages into your Java project:
```java
import com.aspose.slides.*;
```
## Step 1: Load the Presentation
First, load the PowerPoint presentation where you want to add embedded fonts:
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Presentation presentation = new Presentation(dataDir + "Fonts.pptx");
```
## Step 2: Load the Source Font
Next, load the font that you want to embed in the presentation. Here, we're using Arial as an example:
```java
IFontData sourceFont = new FontData("Arial");
```
## Step 3: Add Embedded Fonts
Iterate through all the fonts used in the presentation and add any non-embedded fonts:
```java
IFontData[] allFonts = presentation.getFontsManager().getFonts();
IFontData[] embeddedFonts = presentation.getFontsManager().getEmbeddedFonts();
for (IFontData font : allFonts) {
    boolean embeddedFontsContainsFont = false;
    for (int i = 0; i < embeddedFonts.length; i++) {
        if (embeddedFonts[i].equals(font)) {
            embeddedFontsContainsFont = true;
            break;
        }
    }
    if (!embeddedFontsContainsFont) {
        presentation.getFontsManager().addEmbeddedFont(font, EmbedFontCharacters.All);
        embeddedFonts = presentation.getFontsManager().getEmbeddedFonts();
    }
}
```
## Step 4: Save the Presentation
Finally, save the presentation with the embedded fonts:
```java
presentation.save(dataDir + "AddEmbeddedFont_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
Congratulations! You've successfully embedded fonts in your PowerPoint presentation using Java.

## Conclusion
Adding embedded fonts to your PowerPoint presentations ensures consistent display across various devices, providing a seamless viewing experience for your audience. With Aspose.Slides for Java, the process becomes straightforward and efficient.
## FAQ's
