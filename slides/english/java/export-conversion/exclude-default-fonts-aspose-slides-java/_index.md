# How to Exclude Default Fonts from HTML Conversion Using Aspose.Slides for Java
## Introduction
When converting presentations to HTML, maintaining your custom fonts is crucial due to default font settings. This guide demonstrates how Aspose.Slides for Java can help you exclude these defaults and ensure consistent typography across various platforms.
**What You'll Learn:**
- Setting up the environment with Aspose.Slides for Java
- Techniques to exclude default fonts during HTML conversion
- Key configuration options and their impacts on output
- Practical applications in real-world scenarios
Let's start by discussing prerequisites before diving into the implementation guide.
## Prerequisites
To follow this tutorial effectively, ensure you have:
- **Aspose.Slides for Java Library**: Install version 25.4 or later.
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: This code example targets JDK 16; ensure it's installed on your machine.
- **Basic Java Programming Knowledge**: Familiarity with Java syntax and basic programming concepts is assumed.
## Setting Up Aspose.Slides for Java
### Dependency Installation
**Maven:**
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-slides</artifactId>
    <version>25.4</version>
    <classifier>jdk16</classifier>
</dependency>
```
**Gradle:**
```gradle
implementation group: 'com.aspose', name: 'aspose-slides', version: '25.4', classifier: 'jdk16'
```
Alternatively, download the library directly from [Aspose.Slides for Java releases](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).
### License Acquisition
Start with a free trial or request a temporary license to explore all features without limitations. For long-term use, purchasing a license is recommended.
**Basic Setup:**
To initialize Aspose.Slides in your project:
```java
import com.aspose.slides.Presentation;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Presentation pres = new Presentation("your-pptx-file-path");
        // Your code to manipulate the presentation
    }
}
```
## Implementation Guide
### Feature Overview: Excluding Default Fonts from HTML Conversion
This feature helps customize font handling during PowerPoint file conversion to HTML, enhancing branding and consistency.
#### Step 1: Prepare Your Environment
Ensure Aspose.Slides is correctly set up as per the instructions above. This involves adding dependencies or downloading the JAR directly into your project.
#### Step 2: Load the Presentation
Load your presentation using the `Presentation` class:
```java
String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/presentation.pptx";
try {
    Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir);
```
#### Step 3: Define Font Exclusions
Create an array to specify fonts you wish to exclude. In this example, we start with an empty list as a placeholder:
```java
String[] fontNameExcludeList = {};
```
#### Step 4: Initialize Custom HTML Controller
The `LinkAllFontsHtmlController` class is used for custom font handling during the conversion process.
```java
LinkAllFontsHtmlController linkcont = new LinkAllFontsHtmlController(fontNameExcludeList, "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY");
```
#### Step 5: Configure HTML Options
Set up your `HtmlOptions` to use the custom formatter:
```java
HtmlOptions htmlOptionsEmbed = new HtmlOptions();
htmlOptionsEmbed.setHtmlFormatter(HtmlFormatter.createCustomFormatter(linkcont));
```
#### Step 6: Save as HTML
Finally, save the converted presentation in HTML format:
```java
pres.save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/pres.html", SaveFormat.Html, htmlOptionsEmbed);
} catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
**Explanation:** This code snippet demonstrates how to exclude default fonts by configuring a custom formatter during HTML conversion.
## Practical Applications
1. **Web-Based Presentations**: Embed presentations on corporate websites while maintaining brand consistency.
2. **Document Portability**: Ensure documents look the same across different devices and platforms.
3. **Integration with CMS**: Seamlessly integrate into content management systems where custom fonts are essential.
## Performance Considerations
- **Optimize Memory Usage**: Use Aspose.Slides' memory management features to handle large presentations efficiently.
- **Resource Management**: Close streams properly after operations to free up resources.
- **Best Practices**: Regularly update your library version for performance improvements and bug fixes.
## Conclusion
You've learned how to exclude default fonts during HTML conversion using Aspose.Slides for Java. This capability enhances presentation consistency across different platforms, crucial for branding and professional documentation.
To further enhance your skills, explore other features of Aspose.Slides or integrate this functionality into larger projects.
**Next Steps:**
Experiment with different font exclusions and see how they impact the final HTML output. Consider integrating these techniques into automated workflows to streamline document conversion processes.
