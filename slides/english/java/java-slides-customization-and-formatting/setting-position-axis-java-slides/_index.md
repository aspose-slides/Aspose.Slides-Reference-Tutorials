## Introduction to Setting Position Axis in Aspose.Slides for Java

In this tutorial, we will learn how to set the position axis in a chart using Aspose.Slides for Java. Positioning the axis can be useful when you want to customize the appearance and layout of your chart. We will create a clustered column chart and adjust the position of the horizontal axis between categories.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the Aspose.Slides for Java library installed and set up in your Java project. You can download the library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).

## Step 1: Creating a Presentation

First, let's create a new presentation to work with:

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Presentation pres = new Presentation();
```

Make sure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your document directory.

## Step 2: Adding a Chart

Next, we will add a clustered column chart to the slide. We specify the chart type, position (x, y coordinates), and dimensions (width and height) of the chart:

```java
IChart chart = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().addChart(ChartType.ClusteredColumn, 50, 50, 450, 300);
```

Here, we've added a clustered column chart at position (50, 50) with a width of 450 and a height of 300. You can adjust these values as needed.

## Step 3: Setting Position Axis

To set the position axis between categories, you can use the following code:

```java
chart.getAxes().getHorizontalAxis().setAxisBetweenCategories(true);
```

This code sets the horizontal axis to display between categories, which can be useful for certain chart layouts.

## Step 4: Saving the Presentation

Finally, let's save the presentation with the chart:

```java
pres.save(dataDir + "AsposeClusteredColumnChart.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

Replace `"AsposeClusteredColumnChart.pptx"` with your desired file name.

That's it! You've successfully created a clustered column chart and set the position axis between categories using Aspose.Slides for Java.

## Complete Source Code
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Presentation pres = new Presentation();
try
{
	IChart chart = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().addChart(ChartType.ClusteredColumn, 50, 50, 450, 300);
	chart.getAxes().getHorizontalAxis().setAxisBetweenCategories(true);
	pres.save(dataDir + "AsposeScatterChart.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
}
finally
{
	if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
}
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've explored how to set the position axis in a chart using Aspose.Slides for Java. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you've learned how to create a clustered column chart and customize its appearance by positioning the horizontal axis between categories. Aspose.Slides for Java provides powerful features for working with charts and presentations, making it a valuable tool for Java developers.

## FAQ's

### How do I customize the chart further?

You can customize various aspects of the chart, including data series, chart title, legends, and more. Refer to the [Aspose.Slides for Java documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/) for detailed instructions and examples.

### Can I change the chart type?

Yes, you can change the chart type by modifying the `ChartType` parameter when adding the chart. Aspose.Slides for Java supports various chart types like bar charts, line charts, and more.

### Where can I find more examples and documentation?

You can find comprehensive documentation and more examples on the [Aspose.Slides for Java documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/java/) page.

Remember to dispose of the presentation object when you're done with it to release system resources:

```java
if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
```

That's it for this tutorial. You've learned how to set the position axis in a chart using Aspose.Slides for Java.
