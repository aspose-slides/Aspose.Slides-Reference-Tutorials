## Implementation Guide

This section walks you through the steps needed to convert your PowerPoint presentations while maintaining font consistency.

### Saving Presentation as HTML with Default Regular Font

Converting a presentation into an HTML format allows it to be viewed in any web browser, ensuring broader accessibility. Here's how to set a default regular font for this conversion:

#### Step 1: Initialize the Presentation Object
Load your PowerPoint file using the `Presentation` class.
```java
String dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/DefaultFonts.pptx"; // Replace with your document directory path
Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir);
```

#### Step 2: Configure HTML Options
Set up `HtmlOptions`, specifying the default regular font you want to use in the exported HTML file.
```java
HtmlOptions htmlOpts = new HtmlOptions();
htmlOpts.setDefaultRegularFont("Arial Black"); // Set your desired font
```

#### Step 3: Save as HTML
Finally, save your presentation using the configured options:
```java
String outPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/";
pres.save(outPath + "Presentation-out-ArialBlack.html", SaveFormat.Html, htmlOpts);
```
Repeat these steps with a different font if needed.

### Saving Presentation as PDF with Default Regular Font
Exporting to PDF ensures that your presentations can be shared in a universally compatible format. Here's how you can specify the default regular font for PDF conversion:

#### Step 1: Initialize PdfOptions
Similar to HTML, start by configuring `PdfOptions`.
```java
PdfOptions pdfOpts = new PdfOptions();
pdfOpts.setDefaultRegularFont("Arial Black"); // Set your desired font here as well
```

#### Step 2: Save as PDF
Export the presentation with these options:
```java
pres.save(outPath + "Presentation-out-ArialBlack.pdf", SaveFormat.Pdf, pdfOpts);
```

## Practical Applications
1. **Consistent Branding:** Ensure that all exported documents from a single source reflect your brand’s font style.
2. **Web Publishing:** Convert presentations into HTML for easy sharing on the web with uniform typography.
3. **Document Distribution:** Share PDF versions of presentations to maintain consistent formatting across different devices.
