## Introduction Convert to Markdown in Java Slides

In this step-by-step guide, you will learn how to convert a PowerPoint presentation to Markdown format using Aspose.Slides for Java. Aspose.Slides is a powerful API that allows you to work with PowerPoint presentations programmatically. We will walk through the process and provide the Java source code for each step.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Aspose.Slides for Java: You need to have Aspose.Slides for Java API installed. You can download it from [here](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/).
- Java Development Environment: You should have a Java development environment set up on your machine.

## Step 1: Import Aspose.Slides Library

First, you need to import the Aspose.Slides library into your Java project. You can do this by adding the following Maven dependency to your project's `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-slides</artifactId>
    <version>YOUR_VERSION_HERE</version>
</dependency>
```

Replace `YOUR_VERSION_HERE` with the appropriate version of Aspose.Slides for Java.

## Step 2: Load the PowerPoint Presentation

Next, you'll load the PowerPoint presentation that you want to convert to Markdown. In this example, we assume that you have a presentation file named "PresentationDemo.pptx."

```java
// Path to source presentation
String presentationName = "PresentationDemo.pptx";
Presentation pres = new Presentation(presentationName);
```

Make sure to provide the correct path to your presentation file.

## Step 3: Set Markdown Conversion Options

Now, let's set the options for Markdown conversion. We will specify that we want to export visual content and set a folder for saving images.

```java
// Path and folder name for saving markdown data
String outPath = "output-folder/";

// Create Markdown creation options
MarkdownSaveOptions mdOptions = new MarkdownSaveOptions();

// Set parameter for render all items (items that are grouped will be rendered together).
mdOptions.setExportType(MarkdownExportType.Visual);

// Set folder name for saving images
mdOptions.setImagesSaveFolderName("md-images");

// Set path for folder images
mdOptions.setBasePath(outPath);
```

You can adjust these options according to your requirements.

## Step 4: Convert Presentation to Markdown

Now, let's convert the loaded presentation to Markdown format and save it.

```java
// Save presentation in Markdown format
pres.save(outPath + "pres.md", SaveFormat.Md, mdOptions);
```

Replace `"pres.md"` with the desired name for your Markdown file.

## Step 5: Cleanup

Finally, don't forget to dispose of the presentation object when you're done.

```java
if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
```
