## Introduction to Convert PowerPoint to PDF with Progress Updates in Java Using Aspose.Slides for Java

In this step-by-step guide, we will demonstrate how to convert a PowerPoint presentation (PPTX) to a PDF file in Java using Aspose.Slides for Java. Additionally, we will include progress updates during the conversion process.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java development environment set up.
- Aspose.Slides for Java library added to your project. You can download it from [here](https://downloads.aspose.com/slides/java).

## Step 1: Import Aspose.Slides for Java Library

To get started, you need to import the Aspose.Slides library into your Java project. Make sure you have added the Aspose.Slides JAR files to your classpath.

```java
import com.aspose.slides.*;
```

## Step 2: Create a Java Class

Create a Java class where you will perform the PowerPoint to PDF conversion. Let's name it `PowerPointToPdfConverter`.

```java
public class PowerPointToPdfConverter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // The path to the documents directory.
        String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
        Presentation presentation = new Presentation(dataDir + "ConvertToPDF.pptx");
        try {
            ISaveOptions saveOptions = new PdfOptions();
            saveOptions.setProgressCallback(new ExportProgressHandler());
            presentation.save(dataDir + "ConvertToPDF.pdf", SaveFormat.Pdf, saveOptions);
        } finally {
            if (presentation != null) presentation.dispose();
        }
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Implement Progress Callback

We will implement a progress callback handler to receive updates during the conversion process. Let's create a class named `ExportProgressHandler` for this purpose.

```java
class ExportProgressHandler implements IProgressCallback {
    public void reporting(double progressValue) {
        // Use progress percentage value here
        long progress = Math.round(progressValue);
        System.out.println(progress + "% file converted");
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Replace 'Your Document Directory'

Replace `"Your Document Directory"` in the `PowerPointToPdfConverter` class with the actual path to your PowerPoint file and the desired output directory.

## Step 5: Compile and Run

Compile your Java class and run the `PowerPointToPdfConverter` class. It will convert the PowerPoint presentation to a PDF file while providing progress updates in the console.

```java
        // The path to the documents directory.
        String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
        Presentation presentation = new Presentation(dataDir + "ConvertToPDF.pptx");
        try
        {
            ISaveOptions saveOptions = new PdfOptions();
            saveOptions.setProgressCallback(new ExportProgressHandler());
            presentation.save(dataDir + "ConvertToPDF.pdf", SaveFormat.Pdf, saveOptions);
        }
        finally
        {
            if (presentation != null) presentation.dispose();
        }
    }
}
class ExportProgressHandler implements IProgressCallback
{
    public void reporting(double progressValue)
    {
        // Use progress percentage value here
        long progress = Math.round(progressValue);
        System.out.println(progress + "% file converted");
```

## Conclusion

In this step-by-step guide, we explored how to convert a PowerPoint presentation (PPTX) to a PDF file in Java using Aspose.Slides for Java. Additionally, we implemented progress updates during the conversion process to keep track of the operation's status.

## FAQ's
