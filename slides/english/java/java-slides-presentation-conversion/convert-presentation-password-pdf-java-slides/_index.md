# Convert Presentation to Password-Protected PDF in Java Slides


## Introduction to Convert Presentation to Password-Protected PDF in Java Slides

In this tutorial, we will explore how to convert a presentation to a password-protected PDF using the Aspose.Slides for Java API. Aspose.Slides for Java is a powerful library that allows you to work with PowerPoint presentations programmatically. With its capabilities, you can not only create and manipulate presentations but also convert them to various formats, including PDF. Adding a password to the PDF ensures that only authorized individuals can access its content.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.Slides for Java library: You can download it from the Aspose website [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).

2. Java Development Environment: Ensure you have Java installed on your system.

## Step 1: Initialize the Aspose.Slides Library

In your Java project, make sure to import the Aspose.Slides library. You can add it as a dependency in your build tool, such as Maven or Gradle. Here's an example of how you can import the library:

```java
// Import the necessary classes from Aspose.Slides for Java
import com.aspose.slides.Presentation;
import com.aspose.slides.PdfOptions;
import com.aspose.slides.SaveFormat;
```

## Step 2: Load the Presentation

You should have your PowerPoint presentation file ready. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` and `"DemoFile.pptx"` with the actual path to your presentation file:

```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Instantiate a Presentation object that represents a presentation file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation(dataDir + "DemoFile.pptx");
```

## Step 3: Set PDF Options

Now, let's define the PDF conversion options. In this step, you will also set the password for the PDF. Replace `"password"` with your desired password:

```java
// Instantiate the PdfOptions class
PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();

// Setting PDF password
pdfOptions.setPassword("password");
```

## Step 4: Convert to PDF

It's time to convert the presentation to a password-protected PDF:

```java
// Save the presentation to a password-protected PDF
presentation.save(dataDir + "PasswordProtectedPDF_out.pdf", SaveFormat.Pdf, pdfOptions);
```

## Step 5: Dispose of Resources

To ensure proper resource management, dispose of the Presentation object when you're done with it:

```java
if (presentation != null) presentation.dispose();
```

Congratulations! You've successfully converted a presentation to a password-protected PDF using Aspose.Slides for Java.

```

### Can I change the password of an existing password-protected PDF using Aspose.Slides?
