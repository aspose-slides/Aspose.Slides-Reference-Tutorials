This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process using Aspose.Slides for Java. By the end of this article, you'll be equipped with the knowledge and source code to accomplish this task seamlessly.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the conversion process, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

    // Saving the presentation to TIFF notes
    presentation.save(dataDir + "Notes_In_Tiff_out.tiff", SaveFormat.Tiff);
} finally {
    if (presentation != null) presentation.dispose();
}
```
