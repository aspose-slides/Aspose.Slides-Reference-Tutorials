## Introduction to Convert with Note to TIFF in Java Slides

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to convert a PowerPoint presentation with speaker notes to TIFF format using Aspose.Slides for Java. This library provides powerful features for working with PowerPoint files programmatically.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Aspose.Slides for Java Library: You should have the Aspose.Slides for Java library installed. You can download it from the website [here](https://downloads.aspose.com/slides/java).

2. Java Development Environment: Ensure you have a Java development environment set up on your system.

3. A PowerPoint Presentation: Prepare a PowerPoint presentation (`ConvertWithNoteToTiff.pptx`) that contains speaker notes.

## Step 1: Import Aspose.Slides Library

Import the necessary classes from the Aspose.Slides library at the beginning of your Java code.

```java
import com.aspose.slides.INotesCommentsLayoutingOptions;
import com.aspose.slides.NotesPositions;
import com.aspose.slides.Presentation;
import com.aspose.slides.SaveFormat;
import com.aspose.slides.TiffOptions;
```

## Step 2: Set Up the Presentation and TIFF Options

Define the path to your presentation file (`ConvertWithNoteToTiff.pptx`) and create a `Presentation` object. Then, configure the `TiffOptions` for the conversion.

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir + "ConvertWithNoteToTiff.pptx");

try {
    TiffOptions opts = new TiffOptions();
    INotesCommentsLayoutingOptions notesOptions = opts.getNotesCommentsLayouting();
    notesOptions.setNotesPosition(NotesPositions.BottomFull);
    // Additional TIFF options can be set here if needed

    // Step 3: Save the Presentation with Speaker Notes to TIFF
    pres.save(dataDir + "TestNotes_out.tiff", SaveFormat.Tiff, opts);
} finally {
    if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
}
```

## Step 3: Save the Presentation with Speaker Notes to TIFF

Inside the `try` block, use the `pres.save` method to save the presentation with speaker notes to a TIFF file. The `SaveFormat.Tiff` parameter specifies the output format.

## Step 4: Clean Up Resources

In the `finally` block, ensure you dispose of the `Presentation` object to release any allocated resources.

That's it! You have successfully converted a PowerPoint presentation with speaker notes to TIFF format using Aspose.Slides for Java.

	INotesCommentsLayoutingOptions notesOptions = opts.getNotesCommentsLayouting();
	notesOptions.setNotesPosition(NotesPositions.BottomFull);
	// Saving the presentation to TIFF notes
	pres.save(dataDir + "TestNotes_out.tiff", SaveFormat.Tiff, opts);
}
