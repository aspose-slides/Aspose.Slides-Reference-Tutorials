## Introduction to Convert Presentation to Responsive HTML in Java Slides

In the world of presentations, the ability to convert them into responsive HTML format is a valuable skill. With Java Slides, this task becomes not only achievable but also efficient. In this step-by-step guide, we'll explore how to convert a presentation to responsive HTML using the Aspose.Slides for Java library. Let's dive right in!

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Slides for Java library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).

## Step 1: Setting up Your Project

First, create a new Java project in your preferred integrated development environment (IDE). Make sure to include the Aspose.Slides for Java library in your project's classpath.

## Step 2: Import Necessary Packages

In your Java class, import the necessary packages to work with Aspose.Slides and HTML conversion:

```java
import com.aspose.slides.HtmlFormatter;
import com.aspose.slides.HtmlOptions;
import com.aspose.slides.Presentation;
import com.aspose.slides.ResponsiveHtmlController;
import com.aspose.slides.SaveFormat;
```

## Step 3: Load the Presentation

Now, let's load the presentation you want to convert. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your presentation file:

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Presentation presentation = new Presentation(dataDir + "Convert_HTML.pptx");
```

## Step 4: Configure HTML Conversion

We need to configure the HTML conversion options, including the HTML formatter. Aspose.Slides allows us to use a custom HTML formatter for more control over the conversion:

```java
ResponsiveHtmlController controller = new ResponsiveHtmlController();
HtmlOptions htmlOptions = new HtmlOptions();
htmlOptions.setHtmlFormatter(HtmlFormatter.createCustomFormatter(controller));
```

## Step 5: Save as Responsive HTML

Now, it's time to convert the presentation to responsive HTML and save it:

```java
presentation.save(dataDir + "ConvertPresentationToResponsiveHTML_out.html", SaveFormat.Html, htmlOptions);
```

## Complete Source Code For Convert Presentation to Responsive HTML in Java Slides

```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Instantiate a Presentation object that represents a presentation file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation(dataDir + "Convert_HTML.pptx");
try
{
	ResponsiveHtmlController controller = new ResponsiveHtmlController();
	HtmlOptions htmlOptions = new HtmlOptions();
	htmlOptions.setHtmlFormatter(HtmlFormatter.createCustomFormatter(controller));
	// Saving the presentation to HTML
	presentation.save(dataDir + "ConvertPresentationToResponsiveHTML_out.html", SaveFormat.Html, htmlOptions);
}
finally
{
	if (presentation != null) presentation.dispose();
}
```
