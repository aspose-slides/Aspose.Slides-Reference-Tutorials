## Introduction to Converting Presentation to HTML with Embed All Fonts in Java Slides

In today's digital age, converting presentations to HTML has become essential for sharing information seamlessly across various platforms. When working with Java Slides, it's crucial to ensure that all fonts used in your presentation are embedded to maintain consistent formatting. In this step-by-step guide, we will walk you through the process of converting a presentation to HTML while embedding all fonts using Aspose.Slides for Java. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code and the conversion process, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Aspose.Slides for Java API, which you can download from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).
- A presentation file (e.g., `presentation.pptx`) that you want to convert to HTML.

## Step 1: Setting up the Java Environment

Ensure you have Java and Aspose.Slides for Java API properly installed on your system. You can refer to the documentation for installation instructions.

## Step 2: Loading the Presentation File

In your Java code, you need to load the presentation file you want to convert. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your presentation file.

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir + "presentation.pptx");
```

## Step 3: Embedding All Fonts in the Presentation

To embed all fonts used in the presentation, you can use the following code snippet. This ensures that the HTML output will include all necessary fonts for consistent rendering.

```java
try
{
    // Exclude default presentation fonts
    String[] fontNameExcludeList = {  };
    LinkAllFontsHtmlController linkcont = new LinkAllFontsHtmlController(fontNameExcludeList, "C:\\Windows\\Fonts\\");
    HtmlOptions htmlOptionsEmbed = new HtmlOptions();
    htmlOptionsEmbed.setHtmlFormatter(HtmlFormatter.createCustomFormatter(linkcont));
    pres.save("Your Output Directory" + "pres.html", SaveFormat.Html, htmlOptionsEmbed);
}
finally
{
    if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
}
```

## Step 4: Converting the Presentation to HTML

Now that we have embedded all fonts, it's time to convert the presentation to HTML. The code provided in Step 3 will handle this conversion.

## Step 5: Saving the HTML File

The final step is to save the HTML file with embedded fonts. The HTML file will be saved in the specified directory, ensuring that all fonts are included.

That's it! You've successfully converted a presentation to HTML while embedding all fonts using Aspose.Slides for Java.

## Complete Source Code

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir + "presentation.pptx");
try
{
	// exclude default presentation fonts
	String[] fontNameExcludeList = {  };
	LinkAllFontsHtmlController linkcont = new LinkAllFontsHtmlController(fontNameExcludeList, "C:\\Windows\\Fonts\\");
	HtmlOptions htmlOptionsEmbed = new HtmlOptions();
	htmlOptionsEmbed.setHtmlFormatter(HtmlFormatter.createCustomFormatter(linkcont));
	pres.save("Your Output Directory" + "pres.html", SaveFormat.Html, htmlOptionsEmbed);
}
finally
{
	if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
}
```
