slide.getBackground().setType(BackgroundType.OwnBackground);
```
## Step 5: Add a Section
Add a new section to the presentation:
```java
pres.getSections().addSection("Section 1", slide);
```
## Step 6: Add a Section Zoom Frame
Add a `SectionZoomFrame` object to the slide:
```java
ISectionZoomFrame sectionZoomFrame = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().addSectionZoomFrame(20, 20, 300, 200, pres.getSections().get_Item(1));
```
## Step 7: Save Presentation
Save the presentation with the section zoom:
```java
pres.save(resultPath, SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
