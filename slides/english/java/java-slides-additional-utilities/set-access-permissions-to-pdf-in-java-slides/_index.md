## Introduction to Set Access Permissions to PDF in Java Slides

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore how to set access permissions to a PDF document using Java Slides, a powerful library provided by Aspose. You'll learn how to protect your PDF files by applying password protection and controlling various permissions, such as printing and high-quality printing. We'll walk you through the steps with clear explanations and provide Java source code examples for each part of the process.

## Setting up Your Java Environment

Before we begin, ensure you have Java installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Java from the website.

## Adding Aspose.Slides to Your Project

To use Aspose.Slides for Java, you need to add it to your project. You can do this by including the Aspose.Slides JAR file in your project's classpath.

## Step 1: Creating a New Presentation

Let's start by creating a new presentation using Aspose.Slides. We'll use this presentation as the basis for our PDF document.

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Presentation presentation = new Presentation();
```

## Step 2: Setting Password Protection

To protect our PDF document, we'll set a password for it. This ensures that only authorized users can access the content.

```java
PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
pdfOptions.setPassword("my_password");
```

## Step 3: Defining Access Permissions

Now comes the crucial part: defining access permissions. Aspose.Slides for Java allows you to control various permissions. In our example, we'll enable printing and high-quality printing.

```java
pdfOptions.setAccessPermissions(PdfAccessPermissions.PrintDocument | PdfAccessPermissions.HighQualityPrint);
```

## Step 4: Saving the PDF Document

With all settings in place, we can now save our PDF document with the specified access permissions.

```java
try
{
    presentation.save(dataDir + "PDFWithPermissions.pdf", SaveFormat.Pdf, pdfOptions);
}
finally
{
    if (presentation != null) presentation.dispose();
}
```

## Complete Source Code For Set Access Permissions to PDF in Java Slides

        Presentation presentation = new Presentation();
        try
        {
            presentation.save(dataDir + "PDFWithPermissions.pdf", SaveFormat.Pdf, pdfOptions);
        }
        finally
        {
