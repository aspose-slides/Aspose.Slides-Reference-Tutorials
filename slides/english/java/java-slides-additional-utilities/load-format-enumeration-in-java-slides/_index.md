# Load Format Enumeration in Java Slides


## Introduction to Loading Presentation Format in Java Slides

In this tutorial, we will explore how to determine the format of a PowerPoint presentation using the Aspose.Slides for Java API. We'll specifically focus on loading a presentation and checking its format using the `LoadFormat` enumeration. This will help you identify whether the presentation is in an older format, such as PowerPoint 95, or a more recent format.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the Aspose.Slides for Java library installed and set up in your Java project. You can download it from the [Aspose website](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) and follow the installation instructions.

## Step 1: Import Required Classes

To get started, you need to import the necessary classes from the Aspose.Slides library. These classes will allow us to work with presentations and check their formats.

```java
import com.aspose.slides.LoadFormat;
import com.aspose.slides.PresentationFactory;
```

## Step 2: Load the Presentation

In this step, we will load the PowerPoint presentation file that you want to check for its format. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your presentation file.

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
boolean isOldFormat = PresentationFactory.getInstance().getPresentationInfo(dataDir + "presentation.ppt").getLoadFormat() == LoadFormat.Ppt95;
```

In the code above, we use `PresentationFactory.getInstance().getPresentationInfo()` to obtain information about the presentation, including its format. We then compare the format with `LoadFormat.Ppt95` to check if it's an older PowerPoint 95 format.

## Complete Source Code For Load Format Enumeration in Java Slides

```java
        // The path to the documents directory.
        String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
        boolean isOldFormat = PresentationFactory.getInstance().getPresentationInfo(dataDir + "presentation.ppt").getLoadFormat() == LoadFormat.Ppt95;
```
## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've learned how to load a PowerPoint presentation in Java using Aspose.Slides and check its format using the `LoadFormat` enumeration. This can be useful when you need to handle presentations of different formats differently in your Java application.
