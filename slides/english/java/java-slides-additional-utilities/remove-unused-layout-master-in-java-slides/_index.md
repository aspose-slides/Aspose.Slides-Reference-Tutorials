## Introduction to Remove Unused Layout Master in Java Slides

If you're working with Java Slides, you may come across situations where your presentation contains unused layout masters. These unused elements can bloat your presentation and make it less efficient. In this article, we will guide you on how to remove these unused layout masters using Aspose.Slides for Java. We will provide you with step-by-step instructions and code examples to achieve this task seamlessly.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the process of removing unused layout masters, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://downloads.aspose.com/slides/java) library installed.
- A Java project set up and ready to work with Aspose.Slides.

## Step 1: Load Your Presentation

First, you need to load your presentation using Aspose.Slides. Here's a code snippet to do that:

```java
String pptxFileName = "YourPresentation.pptx";
Presentation pres = new Presentation(pptxFileName);
```

Replace `"YourPresentation.pptx"` with the path to your PowerPoint file.

## Step 2: Identify Unused Masters

Before removing unused layout masters, it's essential to identify them. You can do this by checking the number of master slides in your presentation. Use the following code to determine the count of master slides:

```java
System.out.println("Master slides number in source presentation = " + pres.getMasters().size());
```

This code will print the count of master slides in your presentation.

## Step 3: Remove Unused Masters

Now, let's remove the unused master slides from your presentation. Aspose.Slides provides a straightforward method to achieve this. Here's how you can do it:

```java
Compress.removeUnusedMasterSlides(pres);
```

This code snippet will remove any unused master slides from your presentation.

## Step 4: Identify Unused Layout Slides

Similarly, you should check the number of layout slides in your presentation to identify unused ones:

```java
System.out.println("Layout slides number in source presentation = " + pres.getLayoutSlides().size());
```

This code will print the count of layout slides in your presentation.

## Step 5: Remove Unused Layout Slides

Remove unused layout slides using the following code:

```java
Compress.removeUnusedLayoutSlides(pres);
```

This code will remove any unused layout slides from your presentation.

## Step 6: Check the Result

After removing the unused masters and layout slides, you can check the count again to ensure they have been successfully removed:

```java
System.out.println("Master slides number in result presentation = " + pres.getMasters().size());
System.out.println("Layout slides number in result presentation = " + pres.getLayoutSlides().size());
```

This code will print the updated counts in your presentation, showing that the unused elements have been removed.

            System.out.println("Layout slides number in source presentation = " + pres.getLayoutSlides().size());
            Compress.removeUnusedMasterSlides(pres);
            Compress.removeUnusedLayoutSlides(pres);
            System.out.println("Master slides number in result presentation = " + pres.getMasters().size());
            System.out.println("Layout slides number in result presentation = " + pres.getLayoutSlides().size());
        } finally {
            if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
        }
```
