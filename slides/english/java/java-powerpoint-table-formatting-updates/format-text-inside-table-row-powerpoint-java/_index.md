# Format Text Inside Table Row in PowerPoint with Java

## Introduction
When working with presentations, creating visually appealing slides is essential to keeping your audience engaged. Formatting text inside table rows can significantly enhance the readability and aesthetics of your slides. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to format text inside a table row in PowerPoint using Aspose.Slides for Java.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the coding part, let's make sure you have everything you need to get started:
- Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have JDK installed on your system. You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
- Aspose.Slides for Java: Download and install the Aspose.Slides for Java library from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans to write and run your Java code.

## Import Packages
Before we start coding, we need to import the necessary packages. Here's how you can do it:
```java
import com.aspose.slides.*;
```
Let's break down the process into multiple steps for better understanding.
## Step 1: Load the Presentation
First, you need to load your PowerPoint presentation. Make sure you have a presentation file with a table already added.
```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Create an instance of Presentation class
Presentation presentation = new Presentation(dataDir + "SomePresentationWithTable.pptx");
```
## Step 2: Access the First Slide
Now, let's access the first slide from the presentation. This is where we'll find our table.
```java
ISlide slide = presentation.getSlides().get_Item(0);
```
## Step 3: Locate the Table
Next, we need to locate the table within the slide. For simplicity, let's assume the table is the first shape on the slide.
```java
ITable someTable = (ITable) slide.getShapes().get_Item(0);
```
## Step 4: Set Font Height for First Row Cells
To set the font height for the first row cells, create an instance of `PortionFormat` and set the desired font height.
```java
PortionFormat portionFormat = new PortionFormat();
portionFormat.setFontHeight(25f);
someTable.getRows().get_Item(0).setTextFormat(portionFormat);
```
## Step 5: Set Text Alignment and Margin
To set the text alignment and right margin for the first row cells, create an instance of `ParagraphFormat` and configure the alignment and margin.
```java
ParagraphFormat paragraphFormat = new ParagraphFormat();
paragraphFormat.setAlignment(TextAlignment.Right);
paragraphFormat.setMarginRight(20);
someTable.getRows().get_Item(0).setTextFormat(paragraphFormat);
```
## Step 6: Set Vertical Text Alignment for Second Row Cells
To set the vertical text alignment for the cells in the second row, create an instance of `TextFrameFormat` and set the vertical text type.
```java
TextFrameFormat textFrameFormat = new TextFrameFormat();
textFrameFormat.setTextVerticalType(TextVerticalType.Vertical);
someTable.getColumns().get_Item(0).setTextFormat(textFrameFormat);
```
## Step 7: Save the Presentation
Finally, save the modified presentation to a new file.
```java
presentation.save(dataDir + "result.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
## Step 8: Clean Up Resources
Always dispose of the presentation object to free up resources.
```java
if (presentation != null) presentation.dispose();
```
