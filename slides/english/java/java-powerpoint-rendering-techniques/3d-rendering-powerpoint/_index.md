# 3D Rendering in PowerPoint

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll explore how to incorporate stunning 3D rendering into your PowerPoint presentations using Aspose.Slides for Java. By following these step-by-step instructions, you'll be able to create captivating visual effects that will impress your audience.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure you have the following:
1. Java Development Environment: Make sure you have Java installed on your system. You can download and install Java from [here](https://www.java.com/download/).
2. Aspose.Slides for Java Library: Download the Aspose.Slides for Java library from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/). Follow the installation instructions provided in the documentation to set up the library in your project.
## Import Packages
To begin, import the necessary packages into your Java project:
```java
import com.aspose.slides.*;

import javax.imageio.ImageIO;
import java.awt.*;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;
```
## Step 1: Create a New Presentation
First, create a new PowerPoint presentation object:
```java
Presentation pres = new Presentation();
```
## Step 2: Add a 3D Shape
Now, let's add a 3D shape to the slide:
```java
IAutoShape shape = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().addAutoShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, 200, 150, 200, 200);
shape.getTextFrame().setText("3D");
shape.getTextFrame().getParagraphs().get_Item(0).getParagraphFormat().getDefaultPortionFormat().setFontHeight(64);
```
## Step 3: Configure 3D Settings
Next, configure the 3D settings for the shape:
```java
shape.getThreeDFormat().getCamera().setCameraType(CameraPresetType.OrthographicFront);
shape.getThreeDFormat().getCamera().setRotation(20, 30, 40);
shape.getThreeDFormat().getLightRig().setLightType(LightRigPresetType.Flat);
shape.getThreeDFormat().getLightRig().setDirection(LightingDirection.Top);
shape.getThreeDFormat().setMaterial(MaterialPresetType.Powder);
shape.getThreeDFormat().setExtrusionHeight(100);
shape.getThreeDFormat().getExtrusionColor().setColor(Color.BLUE);
```
## Step 4: Save the Presentation
After configuring the 3D settings, save the presentation:
```java
String outPptxFile = "Your Output Directory" + "sandbox_3d.pptx";
String outPngFile = "Your Output Directory" + "sample_3d.png";
try {
    ImageIO.write(pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getThumbnail(2, 2), "PNG", new File(outPngFile));
    pres.save(outPptxFile, SaveFormat.Pptx);
} finally {
    if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
}
```
