## Introduction
In this tutorial, you will learn how to manipulate PowerPoint tables in Java using Aspose.Slides. Tables are a fundamental component in presentations, often used to organize and present data effectively. Aspose.Slides provides robust capabilities to create, modify, and enhance tables programmatically, offering flexibility in design and layout.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin this tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of Java programming.
- JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your machine.
- Aspose.Slides for Java library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/java/).
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or any other of your choice.

## Import Packages
To start working with Aspose.Slides for Java, you need to import the necessary packages into your Java project:
```java
import com.aspose.slides.*;
import java.awt.*;
```
## Step 1: Setting Up the Presentation
First, instantiate the `Presentation` class to create a new PowerPoint presentation.
```java
// The path to the directory where you want to save the output presentation
String dataDir = "Your_Document_Directory/";
// Instantiate Presentation class that represents PPTX file
Presentation presentation = new Presentation();
```
## Step 2: Accessing the Slide and Adding a Table
Access the first slide and add a table shape to it. Define columns with widths and rows with heights.
```java
try {
    // Access first slide
    ISlide slide = presentation.getSlides().get_Item(0);
    // Define columns with widths and rows with heights
    double[] dblCols = {70, 70, 70, 70};
    double[] dblRows = {70, 70, 70, 70};
    // Add table shape to slide
    ITable table = slide.getShapes().addTable(100, 50, dblCols, dblRows);
```
## Step 3: Setting Border Format for Each Cell
Iterate through each cell in the table and set border formatting (color, width, etc.).
```java
    // Set border format for each cell
    for (IRow row : table.getRows()) {
        for (ICell cell : (Iterable<ICell>) row) {
            cell.getCellFormat().getBorderTop().getFillFormat().setFillType(FillType.Solid);
            cell.getCellFormat().getBorderTop().getFillFormat().getSolidFillColor().setColor(Color.RED);
            cell.getCellFormat().getBorderTop().setWidth(5);
            // Set similar formatting for other borders (bottom, left, right)
            // ...
        }
    }
```
## Step 4: Merging Cells
Merge cells in the table as needed. For example, merge cells (1,1) to (2,1) and (1,2) to (2,2).
```java
    // Merging cells (1, 1) x (2, 1)
    table.mergeCells(table.get_Item(1, 1), table.get_Item(2, 1), false);
    // Merging cells (1, 2) x (2, 2)
    table.mergeCells(table.get_Item(1, 2), table.get_Item(2, 2), false);
```
## Step 5: Splitting Cells
Split a specific cell into multiple cells based on width.
```java
    // Split cell (1, 1)
    table.get_Item(1, 1).splitByWidth(table.get_Item(2, 1).getWidth() / 2);
```
## Step 6: Saving the Presentation
Save the modified presentation to disk.
```java
    // Write PPTX to Disk
    presentation.save(dataDir + "CellSplit_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
} finally {
    // Dispose of Presentation object
    if (presentation != null) presentation.dispose();
}
```

## Conclusion
Manipulating PowerPoint tables programmatically using Aspose.Slides for Java provides a powerful way to customize presentations efficiently. By following this tutorial, you've learned how to split cells, merge cells, and set cell borders dynamically, enhancing your ability to create visually appealing presentations programmatically.
