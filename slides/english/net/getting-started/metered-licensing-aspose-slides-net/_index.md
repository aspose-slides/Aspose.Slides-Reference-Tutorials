// Basic Initialization
Aspose.Slides.License license = new Aspose.Slides.License();
license.SetLicense("your-license-file.lic");
```

## Implementation Guide

Now let’s focus on implementing the metered licensing feature with Aspose.Slides for .NET.

### Metered Licensing Feature Overview

This feature enables you to monitor API usage, ensuring your application only consumes resources within set limits. We’ll walk through setting and checking a metered license using C# code snippets.

#### Step 1: Create an Instance of the CAD Metered Class

Begin by creating an instance of the `Metered` class:
```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Slides;

public class MeteredLicensingFeature
{
    public static void Run()
    {
        // Instantiate the CAD Metered class
        Metered metered = new Metered();
```

#### Step 2: Set Your Metered License Keys

Pass your specific keys to authorize metered usage:
```csharp
// Set your public and private keys here
metered.SetMeteredKey("YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY", "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY");
```
**Note**: Replace `YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY` and `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` with the actual values provided during license setup.

#### Step 3: Check Metered Data Consumption

You can monitor usage before and after API calls to understand consumption patterns:
```csharp
// Retrieve metered data amounts
decimal amountBefore = Metered.GetConsumptionQuantity();
decimal amountAfter = Metered.GetConsumptionQuantity();
```

#### Step 4: Verify License Acceptance

Ensure your license is active and accepted by the system:
```csharp
// Output the status of the metered license
Console.WriteLine($"Is metered license accepted: {Metered.IsMeteredLicensed()}");
    }
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Invalid Keys**: Double-check your key values for any typos.
- **API Limit Exceeded**: Monitor consumption to prevent exceeding limits.

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world scenarios where metered licensing is beneficial:
1. **Enterprise Resource Management**: Large organizations can efficiently manage API usage across departments.
2. **Cost Optimization in Cloud Services**: Businesses using Aspose.Slides as part of cloud-based solutions can optimize costs by monitoring usage.
3. **Integration with CRM Systems**: Seamlessly integrate slide management within CRM applications to control data processing.

## Performance Considerations

To ensure optimal performance:
- Regularly monitor API consumption to avoid unexpected limits.
- Use efficient coding practices to reduce unnecessary API calls.
- Follow .NET memory management best practices, like disposing of objects appropriately.

## Conclusion

Implementing metered licensing in Aspose.Slides for .NET is a strategic way to manage resources and costs. By following the steps outlined above, you can effectively monitor and control your application's usage of Aspose.Slides APIs.
