### Setting Slide Background to a Solid Color

#### Overview
This section focuses on changing the PowerPoint slide background to a solid color using Aspose.Slides for .NET. This technique helps maintain brand consistency or create visually appealing slides.

##### Step 1: Set Up Your Project and File Paths
Ensure your document and output directories are correctly defined:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

bool isExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir);
if (!isExists)
    System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);
```

##### Step 2: Initialize the Presentation
Create an instance of the `Presentation` class to represent your PowerPoint file:

```csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
    // Accessing the first slide in the presentation
    ISlide slide = pres.Slides[0];
}
```

##### Step 3: Set Background Type and Color
Configure the background type and fill format to change it to a solid color:

```csharp
slide.Background.Type = BackgroundType.OwnBackground;
slide.Background.FillFormat.FillType = FillType.Solid;

// Setting the background color to blue
display.BackgroundColor.SolidFillColor.Color = System.Drawing.Color.Blue;
```

##### Step 4: Save Your Presentation
Finally, save your changes to a new PowerPoint file:

```csharp
pres.Save(outputDir + "ContentBG_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
