# How to Link Fonts in HTML Using Aspose.Slides for .NET

## Introduction

Converting presentations into HTML while maintaining consistent font rendering across platforms can be challenging. **Aspose.Slides for .NET** offers a seamless solution by allowing you to link all fonts used in a presentation directly within the HTML output through embedded font files.

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to implement font linking using Aspose.Slides for .NET and ensure design consistency across different platforms. 

**What You'll Learn:**
- Setting up your environment with Aspose.Slides for .NET
- Linking fonts in HTML conversion
- Writing custom controllers for font embedding
- Practical applications and performance considerations

Let's dive into the steps required to achieve this.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

### Required Libraries and Dependencies
- **Aspose.Slides for .NET** library: The core component for our implementation.

### Environment Setup Requirements
- A development environment with .NET Framework or .NET Core installed.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of C# programming.
- Familiarity with HTML and CSS, particularly the `@font-face` rule.

## Setting Up Aspose.Slides for .NET

To use Aspose.Slides in your .NET project, you need to install the library. Here are several methods:

### Using .NET CLI
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Slides
```

### Using Package Manager Console
```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.Slides
```

### Via NuGet Package Manager UI
- Open your project in Visual Studio.
- Navigate to the "NuGet Package Manager."
- Search for "Aspose.Slides" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition Steps
You can obtain a free trial license to test all features without limitations by following these steps:
1. **Free Trial**: Download a temporary license [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/net/).
2. **Temporary License**: Apply for an extended access [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
3. **Purchase**: For full functionality, purchase a license [here](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

### Basic Initialization and Setup
```csharp
// Create an instance of the License class
easpose.slides.License license = new aspose.slides.License();

// Apply the license from the file path
license.SetLicense("Aspose.Slides.lic");
```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let's implement font linking in HTML conversion using **Aspose.Slides for .NET**.

### Feature Overview: Linking Fonts in HTML Conversion
This feature ensures that all fonts used in a presentation are linked directly within the resulting HTML file by embedding the font files. This method provides a robust solution for maintaining design consistency across different browsers and platforms.

#### Step 1: Create the Custom Controller
Create a custom controller class `LinkAllFontsHtmlController` which inherits from `EmbedAllFontsHtmlController`:
```csharp
using Aspose.Slides.Export;
using System.IO;

public class LinkAllFontsHtmlController : EmbedAllFontsHtmlController
{
    private readonly string m_basePath;

    public LinkAllFontsHtmlController(string[] fontNameExcludeList, string basePath)
        : base(fontNameExcludeList)
    {
        m_basePath = basePath; // Set the directory where font files will be stored
    }
}
```
#### Step 2: Implement Font Writing Method
The `WriteFont` method writes the font data to a file and generates corresponding HTML code for embedding:
```csharp
public override void WriteFont(
    IHtmlGenerator generator,
    IFontData originalFont,
    IFontData substitutedFont,
    string fontStyle,
    string fontWeight,
    byte[] fontData)
{
    // Determine the font name to use, preferring substituted fonts if available.
    string fontName = substitutedFont == null ? originalFont.FontName : substitutedFont.FontName;

    // Construct a file path for the .woff font file.
    string path = Path.Combine(m_basePath, $"{fontName}.woff`);
    
    // Write the font data to the specified file path.
    File.WriteAllBytes(path, fontData);

    // Generate HTML style block embedding the font using @font-face rule.
    generator.AddHtml("<style>");
    generator.AddHtml("@font-face { ");
    generator.AddHtml($"font-family: '{fontName}'; ");
    generator.AddHtml($"src: url('{path}');");
    generator.AddHtml(\
