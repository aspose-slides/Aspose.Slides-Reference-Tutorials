## Implementation Guide

### Configuring Grid Spacing

This feature allows you to programmatically set the grid spacing of PowerPoint slides. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

#### Step 1: Create a New Presentation

Start by creating an instance of the `Presentation` class, which represents your PowerPoint file.

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;

// Initialize a new presentation object
global using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
    // Further configurations will follow here
}
```

#### Step 2: Set Grid Spacing

Set the grid spacing to 72 points. This value corresponds to 1 inch, ensuring uniformity across your slides.

```csharp
// Configure the grid spacing to 72 points (1 inch)
pres.ViewProperties.GridSpacing = 72f;
```

The `GridSpacing` property is crucial for maintaining consistency in design and layout when creating presentations programmatically.

#### Step 3: Save Your Presentation

Finally, save your presentation with the updated grid settings. This example saves it as a PPTX file.

```csharp
// Define the output path
string outFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "GridProperties-out.pptx");

// Save the presentation in PPTX format
pres.Save(outFilePath, SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

Ensure your `outFilePath` is correctly set to avoid file saving errors.

### Troubleshooting Tips
