## Implementation Guide

### Feature: Font Properties Manipulation

This feature allows you to change font styles, colors, and other properties on PowerPoint slides using C#.

#### Step 1: Define Document Directory
Set the path where your PowerPoint files will be stored:
```csharp
csharp
string dataDir = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
```

#### Step 2: Load Presentation
Create a `Presentation` object to work with your PPTX file:
```csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir + "FontProperties.pptx"))
{
    // Your code here
}
```

#### Step 3: Access Slide and TextFrames
Access the slide and its text frames using their positions in the shape collection:
```csharp
ISlide slide = pres.Slides[0];
ITextFrame tf1 = ((IAutoShape)slide.Shapes[0]).TextFrame;
ITextFrame tf2 = ((IAutoShape)slide.Shapes[1]).TextFrame;
```

#### Step 4: Manipulate Font Properties
Change font data, styles, and colors as follows:
```csharp
IParagraph para1 = tf1.Paragraphs[0];
IPortion port1 = para1.Portions[0];

// Define new fonts using FontData
FontData fd1 = new FontData("Elephant");
port1.PortionFormat.LatinFont = fd1;

// Set font properties such as Bold and Italic
port1.PortionFormat.FontBold = NullableBool.True;
port1.PortionFormat.FontItalic = NullableBool.True;

// Change font color to Solid Fill
port1.PortionFormat.FillFormat.FillType = FillType.Solid;
port1.PortionFormat.FillFormat.SolidFillColor.Color = Color.Purple;
```

#### Step 5: Save the Presentation
Save your changes back to a file:
```csharp
pres.Save(dataDir + "WelcomeFont_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure that `Aspose.Slides` is correctly installed and referenced.
- Verify paths for saving/loading files are correct.
