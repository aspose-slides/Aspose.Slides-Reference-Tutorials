## Setting Up Aspose.Slides for .NET
Install the Aspose.Slides library:

**Using .NET CLI:**

dotnet add package Aspose.Slides
```

**Using Package Manager:**

- **Purchase**: Consider purchasing a full license if beneficial.

#### Basic Initialization
After installation, initialize Aspose.Slides in your project:
```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;
// Example initialization code here
```

## Implementation Guide
### Export PowerPoint to HTML with Custom CSS
Convert presentations into styled HTML files using custom CSS.

#### Step 1: Define Directories and Load Presentation
Set up your document and output directories, then load the presentation:
```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;
using Aspose.Slides.Export;

string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";  // Source file location.
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";    // Save HTML location.

// Load the PowerPoint file
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir + "/pres.pptx"))
{
    // Implementation continues here...
}
```

#### Step 2: Apply Custom CSS with Controller
Create a custom header and fonts controller for style management:
```csharp
CustomHeaderAndFontsController htmlController = new CustomHeaderAndFontsController(outputDir + "/styles.css");
```
This step sets up injecting custom CSS into the exported HTML.

#### Step 3: Configure Export Options
Set options for exporting as HTML using Aspose.Slides:
```csharp
HtmlOptions options = new HtmlOptions
{
    HtmlFormatter = HtmlFormatter.CreateCustomFormatter(htmlController),  // Apply your custom formatter here.
};
```
The `HtmlFormatter` allows customization of slide rendering in HTML format.

#### Step 4: Save as HTML
Save the presentation with specified options:
```csharp
pres.Save(outputDir + "/pres.html", SaveFormat.Html, options);
```
This saves the presentation into an HTML file at your desired location, applying all custom styles defined.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Paths**: Ensure paths for source and output directories are correct.
- **CSS Styles**: Verify CSS syntax in `styles.css` to avoid rendering issues.

## Practical Applications
1. **Web Portals**: Display presentation content on websites.
2. **eLearning Platforms**: Use HTML presentations for online courses, enhancing interactivity.
3. **Corporate Presentations**: Share dynamic reports and pitches across platforms seamlessly.
4. **Marketing Campaigns**: Embed styled presentations in digital marketing materials.
5. **Documentation Systems**: Integrate presentation content into technical documentation.
