## Implementation Guide

Letâ€™s break down the implementation into manageable steps for exporting PowerPoint presentations to PDF while embedding OLE data.

### Export PPT to PDF with Embedded OLE Data

**Overview:**
This feature allows you to export a presentation to PDF format, preserving embedded OLE objects and maintaining their functionality and appearance.

#### Step 1: Initialize Presentation Object

```csharp
// Load your PowerPoint file using Aspose.Slides.
Presentation presentation = new Presentation(dataDir + "YourPresentation.pptx");
```
- **Explanation:** Here, we create a `Presentation` object by loading the PPTX file from the specified directory.

#### Step 2: Configure PDF Options

```csharp
// Set up the PDF options to include OLE objects.
PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
pdfOptions.EmbedFullFonts = true; // Ensures fonts are embedded in the PDF
```
- **Parameters:** `EmbedFullFonts` ensures that all fonts are included, preserving text appearance.

#### Step 3: Export Presentation

```csharp
// Save the presentation as a PDF with OLE data.
presentation.Save(outFilePath + "ExportedPresentation.pdf\
