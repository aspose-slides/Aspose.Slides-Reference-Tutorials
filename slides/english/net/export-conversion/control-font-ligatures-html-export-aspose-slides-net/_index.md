## Implementation Guide

### Feature: Disabling Font Ligatures during Export

#### Overview

This section will guide you through disabling font ligatures when exporting a presentation as HTML using Aspose.Slides for .NET.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**Step 1: Set Up Your Project**
Create a new C# project and ensure you have referenced the Aspose.Slides library. 

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;
using Aspose.Slides.Export;
using System.IO;
```

**Step 2: Define Paths for Source and Output**
Identify where your source presentation is located, and set paths for the output HTML files.

```csharp
string presentationName = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "TextLigatures.pptx");
string outPathEnabled = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "EnableLigatures-out.html");
string outPathDisabled = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "DisableLigatures-out.html");
```

**Step 3: Load the Presentation**
Load your presentation file using Aspose.Slides.

```csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation(presentationName))
{
    // Continue with export options configuration
}
```

**Step 4: Export with Ligatures Enabled**
Save the presentation in HTML format to demonstrate default behavior with ligatures enabled.

```csharp
pres.Save(outPathEnabled, SaveFormat.Html);
```

**Step 5: Configure Options to Disable Font Ligatures**
Set up `HtmlOptions` and disable font ligatures.

```csharp
HtmlOptions options = new HtmlOptions { DisableFontLigatures = true };
```

**Step 6: Export with Ligatures Disabled**
Export the presentation again, this time using the configured options.

```csharp
pres.Save(outPathDisabled, SaveFormat.Html, options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your paths are correctly defined to avoid file not found errors.
- Verify that you have applied a valid license to unlock all features without limitations.

## Practical Applications
1. **Brand Consistency**: Maintain brand identity by ensuring text displays exactly as intended across different platforms.
2. **Accessibility Needs**: Improve readability for audiences who may struggle with ligatures in certain contexts.
3. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate presentations into web applications where font rendering consistency is critical.

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize resource usage by managing memory effectively, especially when dealing with large presentations.
- Utilize Aspose.Slides' efficient handling of documents to maintain performance during export operations.
- Follow .NET best practices for garbage collection and object disposal within your application.
