    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            string dataDir = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";

            using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation(dataDir + "ConvertToPDF.pptx"))
            {
                // Configuration steps follow...
```

#### Step 2: Configure PDF Options

Set up the `PdfOptions` to include a progress callback, providing updates during conversion.

```csharp
                ISaveOptions saveOptions = new PdfOptions();
                saveOptions.ProgressCallback = new ExportProgressHandler();

                presentation.Save(dataDir + "ConvertToPDF.pdf", SaveFormat.Pdf, saveOptions);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
