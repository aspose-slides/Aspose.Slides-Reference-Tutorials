## Implementation Guide

### Saving Presentation as HTML with Custom Fonts

#### Overview
This feature demonstrates how to convert a PowerPoint presentation into HTML while specifying different default regular fonts. This ensures consistent typography across various platforms.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Set Up Document Paths:**
Start by defining the directory paths for your source PPT file and output HTML.
```csharp
string dataDir = "/path/to/your/documents";
string outPath = "/output/directory";
```

**2. Load the Presentation:**
Use `Presentation` class to load your PowerPoint file.
```csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir + "/DefaultFonts.pptx"))
{
    // Next steps will follow here...
}
```
*Why?* Loading the presentation is essential as it prepares your document for further manipulation.

**3. Create HTML Options:**
Initialize `HtmlOptions` to specify how you want your PPT converted.
```csharp
HtmlOptions htmlOpts = new HtmlOptions();
```

**4. Set Default Regular Font:**
Customize the default font used in the conversion process.
```csharp
htmlOpts.DefaultRegularFont = "Arial Black";
pres.Save(outPath + "/Presentation-out-ArialBlack.html", SaveFormat.Html, htmlOpts);
```
*Why?* Setting a custom font ensures your presentation maintains its visual consistency when viewed as HTML.

#### Troubleshooting Tips:
- **File Path Errors:** Double-check your directory paths for typos.
- **Missing Fonts:** Ensure the specified fonts are available on your system.

## Practical Applications

1. **Web-Based Presentations:** Host presentations on websites without requiring PowerPoint software.
2. **Email Attachments:** Convert PPT files to HTML for embedding directly in emails, ensuring consistent formatting.
3. **Integration with CMS Platforms:** Embed HTML presentations into content management systems (CMS) like WordPress or Joomla.

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize performance by managing resource usage effectively when handling large presentations.
- Use best practices for .NET memory management to prevent application slowdowns during conversion.
