### Saving Presentations with Unsupported Font Styles Handling
This section focuses on saving your presentations as PDFs while effectively handling unsupported font styles.
#### Overview
Configure `PdfOptions.RasterizeUnsupportedFontStyles` to ensure text in unsupported fonts is rasterized. This prevents formatting issues and maintains visual consistency.
#### Implementation Steps
##### Step 1: Setting Up Your Output Path
```csharp
// Define output path using a placeholder directory
string outFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "UnsupportedFontStyles.pdf");
```
##### Step 2: Creating a New Presentation Instance
```csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
    // Configuration and saving will happen here
}
```
*Note: Use a `using` statement for proper resource disposal.*
##### Step 3: Configuring PDF Options
```csharp
PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions
{
    RasterizeUnsupportedFontStyles = true
};
```
- **RasterizeUnsupportedFontStyles**: Set to `true` to rasterize unsupported fonts as bitmaps.
##### Step 4: Saving the Presentation as PDF
```csharp
pres.Save(outFilePath, SaveFormat.Pdf, pdfOptions);
