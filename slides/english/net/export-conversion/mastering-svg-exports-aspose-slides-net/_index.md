# Master SVG Exports with Aspose.Slides for .NET: Shape and Text Formatting Guide

## Introduction
In the digital presentation world, delivering visually appealing slides is crucial. Converting these slides into scalable vector graphics (SVG) while maintaining custom shape and text formatting can be challenging. This guide will walk you through using Aspose.Slides for .NET to efficiently manage SVG exports with customized formatting. Whether you're a developer or designer, mastering this feature ensures high-quality outputs.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to configure and export slides as SVG files with custom shape and text formatting.
- Implementing a custom SVG formatting controller using Aspose.Slides for .NET.
- Optimizing performance when handling large presentations.

Let's start by covering the prerequisites!

## Prerequisites
Before beginning, ensure you have:
- **Libraries & Versions:** Aspose.Slides for .NET compatible with your development environment.
- **Environment Setup:** A basic understanding of C# and familiarity with .NET project structures.
- **Development Tools:** Visual Studio or any compatible IDE supporting .NET projects.

## Setting Up Aspose.Slides for .NET
To use Aspose.Slides, add it to your project:

**.NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Slides
```

**Package Manager:**
```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.Slides
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:** Search for "Aspose.Slides" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition
- **Free Trial:** Start with a free trial to explore features.
- **Temporary License:** Obtain a temporary license for extended evaluation usage.
- **Purchase:** For long-term use, consider purchasing a license from Asposeâ€™s official site.

### Basic Initialization
To initialize Aspose.Slides in your project:
```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;

Presentation pres = new Presentation();
// Your code here...
```

## Implementation Guide
We'll break down the process into manageable sections for clarity and precision.

### Feature: SVG Shape and Text Formatting using Aspose.Slides
This feature allows you to customize the `tspan` Id attribute when exporting slides to SVG format, ensuring your text elements are uniquely identifiable and styled as needed.

#### Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment
Ensure your project references Aspose.Slides. Define directories for input and output:
```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string pptxFileName = Path.Combine(dataDir, "Convert_Svg_Custom.pptx");
string outSvgFileName = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "Convert_Svg_Custom.svg");

using (Presentation pres = new Presentation(pptxFileName))
{
    using (FileStream stream = new FileStream(outSvgFileName, FileMode.Create))
    {
        // Configure SVG export options
        SVGOptions svgOptions = new SVGOptions
        {
            ShapeFormattingController = new MySvgShapeFormattingController()
        };

        // Export the slide to an SVG file
        pres.Slides[0].WriteAsSvg(stream, svgOptions);
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Creating a Custom SVG Shape and Text Formatting Controller
Implement `MySvgShapeFormattingController` to manage unique Ids for shapes and text spans:
```csharp
using Aspose.Slides.Export;

class MySvgShapeFormattingController : ISvgShapeAndTextFormattingController
{
    private int m_shapeIndex, m_portionIndex, m_tspanIndex;

    public MySvgShapeFormattingController(int shapeStartIndex = 0)
    {
        m_shapeIndex = shapeStartIndex;
        m_portionIndex = 0;
    }

    public void FormatShape(ISvgShape svgShape, IShape shape)
    {
        svgShape.Id = $"shape-{m_shapeIndex++}";
        m_portionIndex = m_tspanIndex = 0; // Reset indices for text formatting
    }

    public void FormatText(ISvgTSpan svgTSpan, IPortion portion, ITextFrame textFrame)
    {
        int paragraphIndex = 0, portionIndex = 0;
        
        foreach (IParagraph para in textFrame.Paragraphs)
        {
            portionIndex = para.Portions.IndexOf(portion);
            if (portionIndex > -1) { paragraphIndex = Array.IndexOf(textFrame.Paragraphs.ToArray(), para); break; }
        }

        if (m_portionIndex != portionIndex)
        {
            m_tspanIndex = 0;
            m_portionIndex = portionIndex;
        }

        svgTSpan.Id = $"paragraph-{paragraphIndex}_portion-{m_portionIndex}_{m_tspanIndex++}";
    }

    public ISvgShapeFormattingController AsISvgShapeFormattingController => this;
}
```
**Key Configuration Options:** By setting `svgOptions.ShapeFormattingController`, you customize how shapes and text are exported, ensuring each has a unique identifier.

### Practical Applications
1. **Branding Consistency:** Use SVG exports to maintain brand colors and styles across different media formats.
2. **Interactive Presentations:** Export slides as SVG for use in web applications where scalability is crucial.
3. **Document Archiving:** Preserve presentation details with high-quality vector graphics for long-term storage.

## Performance Considerations
When working with large presentations, consider these tips:
- **Optimize Resource Usage:** Manage memory efficiently by disposing of objects promptly after use.
- **Batch Processing:** Process slides in batches to reduce memory load and improve speed.
- **Parallelization:** Utilize parallel processing for handling multiple slides simultaneously.

## Conclusion
By mastering SVG shape and text formatting with Aspose.Slides, you've unlocked a powerful toolset for enhancing your presentations. This guide has equipped you with the knowledge to customize exports effectively and apply best practices for optimal performance.

**Next Steps:**
- Experiment with different SVG options.
- Explore further Aspose.Slides capabilities to integrate more features into your projects.
