## Implementation Guide

We'll focus on converting PowerPoint presentations to PDF while including hidden slides.

### Convert PowerPoint to PDF Including Hidden Slides

This functionality allows you to create a complete PDF document with all presentation slides, ensuring even those marked as hidden are included.

#### Step 1: Load the Presentation

Load your PowerPoint file using Aspose.Slides:
```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation(dataDir + "HiddingSlides.pptx"))
{
    // Proceed with conversion steps here
}
```

#### Step 2: Configure PdfOptions

Instantiate and configure `PdfOptions` to include hidden slides:
```csharp
// Instantiate the PdfOptions class
PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();

// Include hidden slides in output PDF
pdfOptions.ShowHiddenSlides = true;
```

#### Step 3: Save as PDF

Save your presentation as a PDF using the configured options:
```csharp
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
presentation.Save(outputDir + "PDFWithHiddenSlides_out.pdf", Aspose.Slides.Export.SaveFormat.Pdf, pdfOptions);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure all file paths are correct and accessible.
