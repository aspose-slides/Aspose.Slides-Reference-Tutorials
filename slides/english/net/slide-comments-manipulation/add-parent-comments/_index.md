Are you looking to enhance your PowerPoint presentations with interactive features? Aspose.Slides for .NET allows you to incorporate comments and replies, creating a dynamic and engaging experience for your audience. In this step-by-step tutorial, we will show you how to add parent comments to slides using Aspose.Slides for .NET. Let's dive in and explore this exciting feature.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.Slides for .NET: Ensure that you have Aspose.Slides for .NET installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/net/).

2. Visual Studio: You'll need Visual Studio to create and run your .NET application.

3. Basic Knowledge of C#: This tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of C# programming.

Now that we have the prerequisites covered, let's proceed to import the necessary namespaces.

## Importing Namespaces

First, you'll need to import the relevant namespaces into your project. These namespaces provide the classes and methods required for working with Aspose.Slides for .NET.

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;
using Aspose.Slides.SlideComments;
```

With the prerequisites and namespaces in place, let's break down the process into multiple steps for adding parent comments to a slide.

## Step 1: Create a Presentation

To get started, you need to create a new presentation using Aspose.Slides for .NET. This presentation will be the canvas on which you'll add your comments.

```csharp
// The path to the output directory.
string outPptxFile = "Output Path";

using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
    // Your code for adding comments will go here.
    
    pres.Save(outPptxFile + "parent_comment.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
}
```

In the code above, replace `"Output Path"` with the desired path for your output presentation.

## Step 2: Add Comment Authors

Before adding comments, you need to define the authors of these comments. In this example, we have two authors, "Author_1" and "Author_2," each represented by an instance of `ICommentAuthor`.

```csharp
// Add comment
ICommentAuthor author1 = pres.CommentAuthors.AddAuthor("Author_1", "A.A.");
IComment comment1 = author1.Comments.AddComment("comment1", pres.Slides[0], new PointF(10, 10), DateTime.Now);

// Add reply for comment1
ICommentAuthor author2 = pres.CommentAuthors.AddAuthor("Autror_2", "B.B.");
IComment reply1 = author2.Comments.AddComment("reply 1 for comment 1", pres.Slides[0], new PointF(10, 10), DateTime.Now);
reply1.ParentComment = comment1;
```

In this step, we create two comment authors and add the initial comment and a reply to the comment.

## Step 3: Add More Replies

To create a hierarchical structure of comments, you can add more replies to existing comments. Here, we add a second reply to "comment1."

```csharp
// Add reply for comment1
IComment reply2 = author2.Comments.AddComment("reply 2 for comment 1", pres.Slides[0], new PointF(10, 10), DateTime.Now);
reply2.ParentComment = comment1;
```

This establishes a conversation flow within your presentation.

## Step 4: Add Nested Replies

Comments can have nested replies as well. To demonstrate this, we add a reply to "reply 2 for comment 1," creating a sub-reply.

```csharp
// Add reply to reply
IComment subReply = author1.Comments.AddComment("subreply 3 for reply 2", pres.Slides[0], new PointF(10, 10), DateTime.Now);
subReply.ParentComment = reply2;
```

This step highlights the versatility of Aspose.Slides for .NET in managing comment hierarchies.

## Step 5: More Comments and Replies

You can continue to add more comments and replies as needed. In this example, we add two more comments and a reply to one of them.

```csharp
IComment comment2 = author2.Comments.AddComment("comment 2", pres.Slides[0], new PointF(10, 10), DateTime.Now);
IComment comment3 = author2.Comments.AddComment("comment 3", pres.Slides[0], new PointF(10, 10), DateTime.Now);

IComment reply3 = author1.Comments.AddComment("reply 4 for comment 3", pres.Slides[0], new PointF(10, 10), DateTime.Now);
reply3.ParentComment = comment3;
```

This step demonstrates how you can create engaging and interactive content for your presentations.

## Step 6: Display the Hierarchy

To visualize the comment hierarchy, you can display it on the console. This step is optional but can be helpful for debugging and understanding the structure.

```csharp
ISlide slide = pres.Slides[0];
var comments = slide.GetSlideComments(null);
for (int i = 0; i < comments.Length; i++)
{
    IComment comment = comments[i];
    while (comment.ParentComment != null)
    {
        Console.Write("\t");
        comment = comment.ParentComment;
    }

    Console.Write("{0} : {1}", comments[i].Author.Name, comments[i].Text);
    Console.WriteLine();
}
```

## Step 7: Remove Comments

In some cases, you might need to remove comments and their replies. The code snippet below demonstrates how to remove "comment1" and all its replies.

```csharp
comment1.Remove();
pres.Save(outPptxFile + "remove_comment.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

This step is useful for managing and updating your presentation content.

With these steps, you can create presentations with interactive comments and replies using Aspose.Slides for .NET. Whether you're looking to engage your audience or collaborate with team members, this feature offers a wide range of possibilities.
