## Implementation Guide

This section explains how to add an audio frame with embedded audio into a presentation.

### Adding an Audio Frame

#### Overview

Embedding audio can enhance the interactivity of your presentations, making them more engaging. We'll walk through creating and embedding an audio file in a slide using Aspose.Slides for .NET.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### 1. Load or Create a Presentation

Start by loading an existing presentation or creating a new one:

```csharp
// Create a new presentation or load an existing one
Presentation pres = new Presentation();
```

##### 2. Access the Slide

Select the slide where you want to embed audio:

```csharp
ISlide slide = pres.Slides[0]; // Access the first slide
```

##### 3. Add Audio Frame

Here's how to add an audio frame with embedded audio:

```csharp
// Define the path for input media and output file
string mediaFile = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "audio.mp3");

// Load the audio file into a FileStream
using (FileStream fs = new FileStream(mediaFile, FileMode.Open))
{
    // Add an audio frame to the slide
    IAudioFrame audioFrame = slide.Shapes.AddAudioFrameEmbedded(50, 150, 100, 100, fs);
    
    // Configure audio properties if needed
    audioFrame.PlayMode = AudioPlayModePreset.OnClick;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **AddAudioFrameEmbedded**: This method adds an audio frame to the slide. The parameters define the position and size of the frame on the slide.
- **PlayMode**: Configures how the audio plays, such as starting automatically or on click.

#### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure the media file path is correct and accessible.
- Check for any exceptions related to file I/O operations and handle them appropriately.
