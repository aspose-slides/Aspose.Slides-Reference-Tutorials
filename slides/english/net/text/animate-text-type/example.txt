//ExSummary:This code demonstrates how to create text animation effects in PowerPoint presentations, specifically showing how to animate text by letter with custom timing between animated parts.
//ExStepSummary:0:The following code shows how to set up the presentation and output file path:
//ExStepSummary:1:The following code shows how to create an elliptical shape with text content:
//ExStepSummary:2:The following code shows how to get the animation timeline from the first slide:
//ExStepSummary:3:The following code shows how to add an appear effect to the shape on click:
//ExStepSummary:4:The following code shows how to set the text animation type to animate by letter:
//ExStepSummary:5:The following code shows how to set the delay between animated text parts:
//ExStepSummary:6:The following code shows how to save the presentation with the animation effect:

//ExStep:0-
// Path to output document
string outFilePath = Path.Combine(RunExamples.OutPath, "AnimateTextEffect_out.pptx");

// Create a new presentation instance
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation())
{
//ExStep:1-
    // Add an elliptical shape to the first slide
    IAutoShape oval = presentation.Slides[0].Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.Ellipse, 100, 100, 300, 150);
    
    // Set the text content for the shape
    oval.TextFrame.Text = "The new animated text";

//ExStep:2-
    // Get animation timeline from the first slide
    IAnimationTimeLine timeline = presentation.Slides[0].Timeline;

//ExStep:3-
    // Add an 'Appear' effect to the shape that triggers on click
    IEffect effect = timeline.MainSequence.AddEffect(oval, EffectType.Appear, EffectSubtype.None, EffectTriggerType.OnClick);

//ExStep:4-
    // Configure the effect to animate text by letter instead of all at once
    effect.AnimateTextType = AnimateTextType.ByLetter;

//ExStep:5-
    // Set negative delay between text parts for overlapping animation
    // Negative value makes letters appear faster (overlapping)
    effect.DelayBetweenTextParts = -1.5f;

//ExStep:6-
    // Save the presentation with the animation effect to PPTX format
    presentation.Save(outFilePath, SaveFormat.Pptx);
