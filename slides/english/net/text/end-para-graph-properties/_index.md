# Creating PowerPoint Presentations with Formatted Text

Aspose.Slides for .NET is a powerful API that allows developers to create, manipulate, and convert PowerPoint presentations without requiring Microsoft PowerPoint. This example demonstrates how to create a simple presentation containing a rectangular shape with formatted text paragraphs.

The code creates a new presentation, adds a rectangular shape to the first slide, and then adds multiple paragraphs with different text formatting options. It shows how to set font properties like size and family for specific portions of text.
