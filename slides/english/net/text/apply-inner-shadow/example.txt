//ExStep:0-
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Create directory if it is not already present.
bool IsExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir);
if (!IsExists)
    System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);

//ExStep:1-
// Instantiate a new Presentation object
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
//ExStep:2-
    // Get the first slide of the presentation
    ISlide sld = pres.Slides[0];

//ExStep:3-
    // Add an AutoShape of Rectangle type with specified dimensions (x, y, width, height)
    IAutoShape ashp = sld.Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, 150, 75, 150, 50);

//ExStep:4-
    // Add an empty TextFrame to the Rectangle
    ashp.AddTextFrame(" ");

    // Access the text frame that was just added
    ITextFrame txtFrame = ashp.TextFrame;

//ExStep:5-
    // Access the default paragraph in the text frame
    IParagraph para = txtFrame.Paragraphs[0];

    // Access the default portion (text segment) in the paragraph
    IPortion portion = para.Portions[0];

    // Set the text content of the portion
