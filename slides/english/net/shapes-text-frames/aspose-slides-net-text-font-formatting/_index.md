## Implementation Guide

We'll break down the implementation into distinct sections based on functionality.

### Adding Text to a Shape

#### Overview
This feature enables you to add custom text within AutoShapes, such as rectangles in your slides. It's crucial for delivering tailored content directly on slide shapes.

#### Steps to Implement

**1. Create and Add an AutoShape**

```csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
    IAutoShape newShape = pres.Slides[0].Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, 100, 100, 400, 75, false);
```
- **Parameters**: 
  - `ShapeType.Rectangle`: Defines the shape type.
  - Coordinates (x=100, y=100) and dimensions (width=400, height=75): Position and size of the shape.

**2. Add a Text Frame**

```csharp
    newShape.AddTextFrame("");
```
- **Purpose**: Initializes an empty text frame to hold your custom text.

**3. Insert Text Portions**

```csharp
    newShape.TextFrame.Paragraphs[0].Portions.Clear();
    
    IPortion portion0 = new Portion("Sample text with first portion");
    IPortion portion1 = new Portion(" and second portion.");
    
    newShape.TextFrame.Paragraphs[0].Portions.Add(portion0);
    newShape.TextFrame.Paragraphs[0].Portions.Add(portion1);
}
```
- **Explanation**: Clear existing portions, then create and add new text segments. This allows for segmented content within a single paragraph.

### Setting Default Font Height for Presentation

#### Overview
Setting a uniform font height across your entire presentation ensures consistency in design and readability.

#### Steps to Implement

**1. Add Text Portions**
Re-use the code for adding text portions as shown above.

**2. Set Default Font Height**

```csharp
    pres.DefaultTextStyle.GetLevel(0).DefaultPortionFormat.FontHeight = 24;
```
- **Purpose**: Applies a consistent font height of 24 points to all text portions in the presentation.

### Setting Default Font Height for a Paragraph

#### Overview
You can customize individual paragraphs within your slides, making specific content stand out.

#### Steps to Implement

**1. Add Text Portions**
As previously outlined.

**2. Customize Font Height for a Specific Paragraph**

```csharp
    newShape.TextFrame.Paragraphs[0].ParagraphFormat.DefaultPortionFormat.FontHeight = 40;
```
- **Explanation**: Sets the font height of all portions within this paragraph to 40 points, enhancing its visual impact.

### Setting Font Height for an Individual Portion

#### Overview
For precise control over your presentation's typography, adjust the font size of specific text portions individually.

#### Steps to Implement

**1. Add Text Portions**
Refer back to the initial steps in adding text portions.

**2. Set Specific Font Heights**

```csharp
    newShape.TextFrame.Paragraphs[0].Portions[0].PortionFormat.FontHeight = 55;
    newShape.TextFrame.Paragraphs[0].Portions[1].PortionFormat.FontHeight = 18;
```
- **Explanation**: This customization gives each portion unique font heights, allowing for detailed emphasis where needed.

### Saving the Presentation

#### Overview
Once your presentation is styled to perfection, save it to a file format of your choice.

```csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
    // Add shapes and text as described above...

    // Save the presentation
    pres.Save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\SetLocalFontHeightValues.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
}
```
- **Details**: This saves your formatted slides into a PPTX file, ready for distribution or further editing.

## Practical Applications
