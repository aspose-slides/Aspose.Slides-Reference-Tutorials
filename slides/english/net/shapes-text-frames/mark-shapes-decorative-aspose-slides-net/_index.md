## Implementation Guide: Marking Shapes as Decorative

In this section, we'll walk through marking a shape as decorative in PowerPoint using C#.

### Adding and Configuring an AutoShape

#### Overview
Creating visual elements in your presentation is straightforward with the `AddAutoShape` method. We’ll mark these shapes as decorative to ensure they enhance design without affecting accessibility tools.

#### Step 1: Create a New Presentation Instance
Start by creating a new instance of a PowerPoint presentation:

```csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
    // Further configuration will happen here
}
```

#### Step 2: Add an AutoShape to the Slide
Add a rectangle shape to your slide at position `(10, 10)` with dimensions `100x100`:

```csharp
IShape shape1 = pres.Slides[0].Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, 10, 10, 100, 100);
```

#### Step 3: Mark the Shape as Decorative
To mark the rectangle as decorative, set `IsDecorative` to true:

```csharp
shape1.IsDecorative = true;
```

This step is crucial for ensuring that screen readers skip over these elements.

#### Step 4: Save Your Presentation
Finally, save your presentation in PPTX format at a specified location:

```csharp
string outFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "DecorativeDemo.pptx");
pres.Save(outFilePath, SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure the output directory exists to avoid file path errors.
- Check for any licensing issues if you're using a trial version.

Understanding how to mark shapes as decorative opens up several possibilities:
1. **Enhancing Presentation Design**: Use this feature to add visually appealing elements that don’t interfere with presentation flow.
2. **Accessibility Compliance**: Ensure your presentations are accessible by marking non-essential visual elements appropriately.
