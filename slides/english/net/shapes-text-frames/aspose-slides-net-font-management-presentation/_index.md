## Implementation Guide

### Load Presentation

**Overview:**
Begin by loading an existing presentation file to manage fonts effectively.

#### Step-by-Step:
1. **Specify the Document Directory:**
   ```csharp
   string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with your directory path
   ```
2. **Load the Presentation:**
   ```csharp
   using Aspose.Slides;
   Presentation presentation = new Presentation(dataDir + "/Fonts.pptx");
   ```
   - `Presentation`: Represents a presentation document.
   - The constructor loads the presentation from the specified file path.

### Manage Fonts in Presentation

**Overview:**
Learn to identify and embed fonts within your slides for consistency across all platforms.

#### Step-by-Step:
1. **Retrieve All Fonts Used:**
   ```csharp
   IFontData[] allFonts = presentation.FontsManager.GetFonts();
   ```
2. **Get Already Embedded Fonts:**
   ```csharp
   IFontData[] embeddedFonts = presentation.FontsManager.GetEmbeddedFonts();
   ```
3. **Embed Non-embedded Fonts:**
   Iterate through the fonts and embed those not already embedded.
   ```csharp
   foreach (IFontData font in allFonts)
   {
       if (!embeddedFonts.Contains(font))
       {
           presentation.FontsManager.AddEmbeddedFont(
               font, EmbedFontCharacters.All);
       }
   }
   // Explanation: This ensures each unique font used is available on any device.
   ```

### Save Presentation

**Overview:**
After managing the fonts, save your modified presentation to ensure changes are preserved.

#### Step-by-Step:
1. **Specify Output Directory:**
   ```csharp
   string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
   ```
2. **Save Changes:**
   ```csharp
   using Aspose.Slides;
   presentation.Save(outputDir + "/AddEmbeddedFont_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
   ```
   - `Save`: Writes the updated presentation to a specified file path.
   - `SaveFormat.Pptx`: Ensures the output is in PowerPoint format.
