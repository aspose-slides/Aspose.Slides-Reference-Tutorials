#### Add and Customize Charts with Rotated Labels
**Overview:**
Adding a chart to your slide can provide valuable data insights. Enhance it by rotating the data labels for better readability or stylistic purposes.

**Steps:**
1. **Create Presentation Instance**

   using Aspose.Slides;

   // Create an instance of Presentation class
   Presentation presentation = new Presentation();
   ```
2. **Add a Chart to Slide**
   ```csharp
   IChart chart = presentation.Slides[0].Shapes.AddChart(ChartType.ClusteredColumn, 50, 50, 500, 300);
   ```
3. **Access and Rotate Data Labels**
   - Configure the first series in the chart to display values.
   - Apply a custom rotation angle for better layout or design.

   ```csharp
   IChartSeries series = chart.ChartData.Series[0];

   // Set data label to show values and apply custom rotation angle
   series.Labels.DefaultDataLabelFormat.ShowValue = true;
   series.Labels.DefaultDataLabelFormat.TextFormat.TextBlockFormat.RotationAngle = 65; // Rotate labels by 65 degrees
   ```

#### Customize Chart Titles with Rotation
**Overview:**
Customizing your chart's title can significantly impact its presentation. Here, we'll rotate the title for a unique visual effect.

**Steps:**
1. **Add and Configure Chart Title**
   ```csharp
   // Add a title to the chart with custom rotation
   chart.HasTitle = true;
   chart.ChartTitle.AddTextFrameForOverriding("Custom title").TextFrameFormat.RotationAngle = -30; // Rotate title by -30 degrees
   ```
2. **Save the Presentation**
   ```csharp
   presentation.Save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/textframe-rotation_out.pptx");
   ```

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure all necessary namespaces are included.
