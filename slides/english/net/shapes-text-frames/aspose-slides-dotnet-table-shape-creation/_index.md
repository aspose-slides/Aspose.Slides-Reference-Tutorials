## Implementation Guide

### Creating a Table on a Slide

**Overview:**
Creating tables is fundamental when you need to present data clearly. With Aspose.Slides, you can define table dimensions and positions easily.

#### Step 1: Initialize Presentation
Start by creating an instance of the `Presentation` class:

```csharp
Presentation pres = new Presentation();
```

#### Step 2: Add a Table
Use the `AddTable` method to add a table to your slide. Specify the position and size for rows and columns:

```csharp
ITable tbl = pres.Slides[0].Shapes.AddTable(50, 50, new double[] { 50, 70 }, new double[] { 50, 50, 50 });
```

**Parameters Explained:**
- `50, 50`: X and Y coordinates for the top-left corner.
- Arrays specify column widths and row heights.

#### Step 3: Save Presentation
Finally, save your presentation:

```csharp
pres.Save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/CreateTable_Out.pptx\
