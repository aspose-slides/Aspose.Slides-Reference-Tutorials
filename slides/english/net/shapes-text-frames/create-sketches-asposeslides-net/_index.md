- Saving presentations and images

Ready to get started? Ensure you have everything needed to follow along!

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, make sure you have the necessary tools and knowledge:

### Required Libraries and Dependencies

You will need:
- .NET SDK (version 5.0 or later recommended)
- Visual Studio or any compatible IDE
- Aspose.Slides for .NET library

### Environment Setup Requirements

Ensure your development environment is ready by installing the required libraries using one of these methods:

**Using .NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Slides
```

**Using Package Manager:**
```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.Slides
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:**
Search for "Aspose.Slides" and install the latest version.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of C# programming.
- Familiarity with .NET development environment (Visual Studio).

## Setting Up Aspose.Slides for .NET

To begin, set up Aspose.Slides in your project by following these steps:
1. **Installation:** Use any of the installation methods mentioned above to add Aspose.Slides to your project.
2. **License Acquisition:**
   - Start with a [free trial](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/net/) or obtain a temporary license for full functionality.
   - To purchase, visit the [purchase page](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).
3. **Basic Initialization:**
   ```csharp
   using Aspose.Slides;
   
   Presentation pres = new Presentation();
   // Your code to manipulate slides goes here.
   ```

## Implementation Guide

With everything set up, let's implement the sketched shape feature.

### Adding and Modifying Shapes

#### Overview

In this section, we'll add an AutoShape of rectangle type on a slide and configure its properties to create a sketched effect.

**Adding a Rectangle Shape**

Start by creating a new presentation instance and adding a rectangle shape:
```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;
using Aspose.Slides.Export;

string outPptxFile = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "SketchedShapes_out.pptx");
string outPngFile = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "SketchedShapes_out.png");

using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
    // Add an AutoShape of Rectangle type on the first slide
    IAutoShape shape = pres.Slides[0].Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, 20, 20, 300, 150);
}
```

#### Setting Fill Format

To give it a sketched appearance, remove any fill from the shape:
```csharp
shape.FillFormat.FillType = FillType.NoFill;
```

### Applying Sketch Effects to Shapes

#### Overview

Next, transform the rectangle into a freehand-style sketch.

**Transforming Shape into a Sketch**

Use the `SketchFormat` property to apply a scribble effect:
```csharp
// Transform the shape into a sketch of freehand style (Scribble)
shape.LineFormat.SketchFormat.SketchType = LineSketchType.Scribble;
```

### Saving Presentations and Images

Finally, save your work as both a presentation file and an image.

**Saving As PPTX**
```csharp
// Save the presentation to a PPTX file
pres.Save(outPptxFile, SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

**Saving As PNG Image**
```csharp
// Save the slide as an image file in PNG format
pres.Slides[0].GetThumbnail(4/3f, 4/3f).Save(outPngFile, System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Png);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Errors:** Ensure all paths are correctly specified and check for any library installation issues.
- **Performance Issues:** Optimize image resolution settings if performance lags.

## Practical Applications

Aspose.Slides .NET offers versatile solutions for various scenarios:
1. **Educational Content:** Create engaging educational slides with sketched diagrams to simplify complex concepts.
2. **Business Presentations:** Enhance the visual appeal of presentations with unique, hand-drawn elements.
3. **Creative Projects:** Use sketch effects in creative storytelling or artistic projects.

Integration possibilities include combining Aspose.Slides features with other .NET applications for enhanced functionality.

## Performance Considerations
- **Optimize Resources:** Minimize resource usage by adjusting image resolutions and slide complexity.
- **Memory Management:** Ensure efficient memory handling by disposing of presentation objects properly after use.

**Best Practices:**
- Dispose of the `Presentation` object in a `using` block to manage resources effectively.
- Regularly update Aspose.Slides to benefit from performance improvements.
