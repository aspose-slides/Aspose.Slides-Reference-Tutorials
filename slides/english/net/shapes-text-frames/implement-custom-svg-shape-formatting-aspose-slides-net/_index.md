# How to Implement Custom SVG Shape Formatting in Aspose.Slides for .NET

## Introduction

Managing and uniquely identifying SVG shapes within presentation slides can be challenging. This tutorial will guide you through using Aspose.Slides for .NET to create a custom SVG shape formatting controller. By implementing this feature, each SVG shape receives a unique ID based on its index in the sequence, ensuring clear identification and organization.

In this tutorial, we’ll cover:
- Setting up your environment with Aspose.Slides
- Implementing the `CustomSvgShapeFormattingController` class
- Practical applications for your projects

Let’s enhance your .NET applications using Aspose.Slides. Before we begin, ensure you meet the prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

To implement custom SVG shape formatting with Aspose.Slides, ensure you have:
- **Required Libraries**: You’ll need Aspose.Slides for .NET (version 22.x or later).
- **Environment Setup**: A development environment set up with either .NET Core or .NET Framework (version 4.6.1 or later).
- **Knowledge Prerequisites**: Familiarity with C# and basic concepts of working with SVG files.

With your prerequisites in check, let's move on to setting up Aspose.Slides for .NET.

## Setting Up Aspose.Slides for .NET

To start using Aspose.Slides, add it as a dependency to your project. Here are the different methods to install it:

### Using .NET CLI
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Slides
```

### Using Package Manager Console
```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.Slides
```

### Via NuGet Package Manager UI
Search for "Aspose.Slides" in the NuGet Package Manager within your IDE and install the latest version.

After installation, acquire a license. For testing purposes, use the free trial available on their website. To unlock full capabilities, consider purchasing a license or applying for a temporary one through Aspose's purchase portal.

### Basic Initialization

Once installed, initialize Aspose.Slides in your application:
```csharp
// Create an instance of Presentation class
var presentation = new Presentation();
```

## Implementation Guide

Now that you're set up with Aspose.Slides, let’s implement the custom SVG shape formatting controller.

### Overview of `CustomSvgShapeFormattingController`

The `CustomSvgShapeFormattingController` is a class that implements the `ISvgShapeFormattingController` interface. Its main purpose is to assign unique IDs to each SVG shape in your presentation based on their index sequence.

#### Step 1: Initialize the Shape Index
```csharp
private int m_shapeIndex;
```
This private integer variable, `m_shapeIndex`, keeps track of the current index for naming shapes.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

Let’s break down each part of the implementation process:

#### Constructor Setup
Firstly, initialize the shape index with an optional starting point.
```csharp
public CustomSvgShapeFormattingController(int shapeStartIndex = 0)
{
    m_shapeIndex = shapeStartIndex;
}
```
**Why**: This constructor allows you to begin naming your shapes from a specific index if needed. It defaults to zero, providing flexibility in sequence management.

#### Formatting the SVG Shape
The core functionality is in the `FormatShape` method:
```csharp
public void FormatShape(ISvgShape svgShape, IShape shape)
{
    // Assign a unique ID based on its index
    svgShape.Id = string.Format("shape-{0}\
