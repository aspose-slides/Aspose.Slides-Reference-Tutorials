### Converting Presentation Files

#### Overview

This feature allows you to transform a PowerPoint file into an adaptive HTML document. We'll walk through each step needed for precise and efficient conversion.

##### Step 1: Define File Paths

Specify the directory paths for both your input presentation files and the output HTML files:
```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
```

##### Step 2: Load Your Presentation

Use the `Presentation` class to load your PowerPoint file, ensuring the path is correctly specified:
```csharp
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation(dataDir + "/Convert_HTML.pptx"))
{
    // Steps continue inside this block
}
```

##### Step 3: Set Up Responsive HTML Controller

To ensure your HTML output is responsive, create an instance of `ResponsiveHtmlController`:
```csharp
ResponsiveHtmlController controller = new ResponsiveHtmlController();
```

This object helps manage how the presentation adapts to different screen sizes.

##### Step 4: Configure HtmlOptions

Next, configure the `HtmlOptions` to use a custom formatter with our responsive HTML controller:
```csharp
HtmlOptions htmlOptions = new HtmlOptions { HtmlFormatter = HtmlFormatter.CreateCustomFormatter(controller) };
```

This step is crucial for ensuring your HTML output looks great across various devices.

##### Step 5: Save the Presentation as Responsive HTML

Finally, save your presentation in HTML format using the specified options:
```csharp\presentation.Save(outputDir + "/ConvertPresentationToResponsiveHTML_out.html\
