## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll break down the implementation into distinct features.

### Converting PowerPoint to HTML5 with Animations

#### Overview
This feature focuses on converting a PowerPoint file to an interactive HTML5 format while maintaining animations and transitions within your slides.

#### Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Load Your Presentation**

Firstly, load your existing presentation using Aspose.Slides:

}
```
*Explanation:* This step initializes a `Presentation` object to work with your PowerPoint file.

**Step 2: Configure HTML5 Options**

Set up options for converting your presentation:

```csharp
Html5Options options = new Html5Options()
{
    AnimateShapes = true,  // Enable animations for shapes in slides
    AnimateTransitions = true  // Enable slide transition animations
};
```
*Explanation:* These settings ensure that animations are retained during the conversion process.

**Step 3: Save as HTML5**

Finally, save your presentation as an HTML5 file:

```csharp
pres.Save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/Demo.html\
