Ready to enhance your document handling? Let's start with the prerequisites.

### Prerequisites

Before implementing this solution, ensure you have:
- **Aspose.Slides for .NET** library installed in your project.
- A development environment such as Visual Studio.
- Basic knowledge of C# and the .NET framework.

## Setting Up Aspose.Slides for .NET

### Installation Information

To use Aspose.Slides, install the library using one of these methods:

**Using .NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Slides
```

**Using Package Manager Console:**
```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.Slides
```

**Via NuGet Package Manager UI:**
- Open your project in Visual Studio.
- Navigate to the "NuGet Package Manager" and search for "Aspose.Slides".
- Click "Install" on the latest version.

### License Acquisition

To use Aspose.Slides, you need a license. You can:
- Start with a **free trial** by downloading it from their site.
- Apply for a **temporary license** to evaluate full features without limitations.
- Purchase a license if your project requires long-term usage.

After acquiring the license, apply it in your application as follows:
```csharp
Aspose.Slides.License license = new Aspose.Slides.License();
license.SetLicense("path_to_your_license.lic");
```

## Implementation Guide

### Convert PPTX to XPS Without Additional Options

This section guides you through converting a PowerPoint presentation into an XPS document using default settings.

#### Step 1: Load the Presentation File

Begin by loading your .pptx file. This step initializes the `Presentation` object with the specified file path:
```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;

string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with actual directory
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Desired output path

// Load the presentation
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir + "/Convert_XPS.pptx"))
{
    // The following steps will process this loaded presentation.
}
```

#### Step 2: Save as XPS Document

Once your presentation is loaded, save it in the XPS format using `SaveFormat.Xps`:
```csharp
using Aspose.Slides.Export;

// Save the presentation as an XPS document without additional options
pres.Save(outputDir + "/XPS_Output_Without_XPSOption_out.xps", SaveFormat.Xps);
```

### Key Considerations
- **Path Variables:** Ensure `dataDir` and `outputDir` are correctly set to your file paths.
- **File Permissions:** Verify that your application has the necessary permissions to read from and write to these directories.

## Practical Applications

Converting PPTX to XPS can be beneficial in various scenarios, including:
1. **Legal Documentation:** Courts often require documents in XPS for secure archiving.
2. **Corporate Reporting:** Convert presentations into a fixed format for distribution.
3. **Publishing:** Distribute content that maintains its layout integrity.

## Performance Considerations

When working with Aspose.Slides, consider the following to optimize performance:
- **Memory Management:** Dispose of `Presentation` objects as soon as they are no longer needed to free up resources.
- **Batch Processing:** If converting multiple files, process them in batches to manage system load effectively.

## Conclusion

You should now be able to use Aspose.Slides for .NET to convert PowerPoint presentations into XPS documents. This guide has walked you through setting up your environment, implementing the conversion code, and understanding practical applications and performance considerations.

As next steps, consider exploring more advanced features of Aspose.Slides or integrating this solution into larger document management systems. Why not give it a try with some of your own presentations?
