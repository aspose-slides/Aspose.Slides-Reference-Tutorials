## Implementation Guide

### Setting Read-Only Recommended Property

This feature ensures your presentations open in read-only mode, protecting them from unauthorized edits.

#### Step 1: Create a New Presentation Object
Start by creating a `Presentation` object:

var pres = new Presentation();
```

#### Step 2: Set ReadOnlyRecommended Property to True
Use the `ProtectionManager` class:
```csharp
// Set the ReadOnlyRecommended property to true
pres.ProtectionManager.ReadOnlyRecommended = true;
```

#### Step 3: Define Output Path and Save
Specify your output path and save the presentation:
```csharp
using System.IO;

// Define output path with actual directory
string outPptxPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "ReadOnlyRecommended.pptx");

// Save the presentation as a PPTX file
pres.Save(outPptxPath, SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Incorrect File Paths:** Ensure your output directory path is correct and accessible.
- **Permission Issues:** Check if you have write permissions for the save directory.

## Practical Applications

1. **Internal Reports:** Share internal reports without risking unauthorized changes.
