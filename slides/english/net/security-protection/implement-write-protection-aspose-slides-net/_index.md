```

## Implementation Guide

Let's implement write protection on your PowerPoint file.

### Setting Write Protection

This feature prevents unauthorized modifications by setting a password. Here’s how you can do it:

#### Step 1: Create or Load a Presentation

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;

// Define the document directory path
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";

// Ensure the output directory exists
if (!System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir))
    System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);

Presentation presentation = new Presentation();
```

#### Step 2: Apply Write Protection

```csharp
// Set write protection password to prevent unauthorized modifications
presentation.ProtectionManager.SetWriteProtection("test");
```
- **Parameters:** The `SetWriteProtection` method takes a string parameter for the password.
- **Purpose:** It sets a password that must be entered to edit the presentation.

#### Step 3: Save the Protected Presentation

```csharp
// Save the protected presentation with .pptx format
presentation.Save(dataDir + "/WriteProtected_out.pptx", Aspose.Slides.Export.SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
- **Save Format:** Ensure you specify `.pptx` as the save format to maintain compatibility.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- If you encounter issues with file paths, verify that the `dataDir` is correctly set.
- Make sure your Aspose.Slides package is up-to-date to avoid deprecated methods.

## Practical Applications

Implementing write protection can be beneficial in various scenarios:
1. **Corporate Presentations:** Protect proprietary business presentations from unauthorized edits during external collaborations.
2. **Educational Materials:** Secure teaching materials shared with students or colleagues.
3. **Marketing Campaigns:** Maintain the integrity of marketing presentations shared across departments.
