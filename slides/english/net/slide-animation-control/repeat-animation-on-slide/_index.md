## Introduction
In the dynamic world of presentations, the ability to control animations plays a pivotal role in engaging and capturing the audience's attention. Aspose.Slides for .NET empowers developers to take charge of animation types within slides, allowing for a more interactive and visually appealing presentation. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to control animation types on a slide using Aspose.Slides for .NET, step by step.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Aspose.Slides for .NET Library: Download and install the library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/net/).
2. .NET Development Environment: Set up a .NET development environment on your machine.
## Import Namespaces
In your .NET project, begin by importing the necessary namespaces to leverage the functionalities provided by Aspose.Slides:
```csharp
using Aspose.Slides.Animation;
using Aspose.Slides.SlideShow;
using Aspose.Slides.Export;
```
## Step 1: Set Up the Project
Create a new directory for your project and instantiate the Presentation class to represent the presentation file.
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
bool IsExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir);
if (!IsExists)
    System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir + "AnimationOnSlide.pptx"))
{
    // Your code goes here
}
```
## Step 2: Access Effects Sequence
Retrieve the effects sequence for the first slide using the MainSequence property.
```csharp
ISequence effectsSequence = pres.Slides[0].Timeline.MainSequence;
```
## Step 3: Access the First Effect
Obtain the first effect of the main sequence to manipulate its properties.
```csharp
IEffect effect = effectsSequence[0];
```
## Step 4: Modify Repeat Settings
Change the effect's Timing/Repeat property to "Until End of Slide."
```csharp
effect.Timing.RepeatUntilEndSlide = true;
```
## Step 5: Save the Presentation
Save the modified presentation to visualize the changes.
```csharp
pres.Save(RunExamples.OutPath + "AnimationOnSlide-out.pptx", Aspose.Slides.Export.SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
Repeat these steps for additional effects or customize them according to your presentation requirements.
