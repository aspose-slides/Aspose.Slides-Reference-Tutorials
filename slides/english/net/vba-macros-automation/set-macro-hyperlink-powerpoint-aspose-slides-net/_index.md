## Implementation Guide

Let's walk through setting a macro hyperlink on a shape.

### Feature Overview: Setting Macro Hyperlink

This feature allows you to attach a macro function to shapes in PowerPoint using Aspose.Slides for .NET, ideal for creating interactive presentations that respond to user inputs.

#### Step 1: Create the Shape

Add an auto-shape to your slide:

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;

string macroName = "TestMacro";
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation())
{
    // Add a Blank Button shape at position (20, 20) with dimensions (80x30)
    IAutoShape shape = presentation.Slides[0].Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.BlankButton, 20, 20, 80, 30);
```

#### Step 2: Set the Macro Hyperlink

Attach a macro to this shape:

```csharp
    // Associate the shape with a macro hyperlink click event
    shape.HyperlinkManager.SetMacroHyperlinkClick(macroName);

    // Save the presentation
    presentation.Save("output.pptx", Aspose.Slides.Export.SaveFormat.Pptx);
}
```
**Explanation:**
- `AddAutoShape(ShapeType.BlankButton, 20, 20, 80, 30)`: Adds a blank button shape at specified coordinates and size.
- `SetMacroHyperlinkClick(macroName)`: Links the macro to the shape's click event.

#### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Macro Not Running:** Ensure the macro exists in your PowerPoint template.
- **Shape Positioning Issues:** Double-check coordinate values for accurate placement on the slide.

## Practical Applications

Integrating macros with shapes can serve various purposes:
1. **Automated Data Entry**: Macros triggered by button clicks can automate repetitive tasks like data entry or formatting.
