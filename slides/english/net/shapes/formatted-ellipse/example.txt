// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Create directory if it is not already present.
bool IsExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir);

//ExStep:1-
// Instantiate Presentation class that represents the PPTX
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())

//ExStep:2-
    // Get the first slide
    ISlide sld = pres.Slides[0];

    // Add autoshape of ellipse type
    IShape shp = sld.Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.Ellipse, 50, 150, 150, 50);

//ExStep:3-
    // Apply some formatting to ellipse shape
