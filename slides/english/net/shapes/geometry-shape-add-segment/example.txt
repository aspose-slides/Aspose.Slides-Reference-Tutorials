//ExSummary:This code demonstrates how to add segments to a GeometryShape in a PowerPoint presentation. It creates a rectangle shape and modifies its geometry path by adding line segments, then saves the presentation.
//ExStepSummary:0:The following code shows how to set up the output file path for the PowerPoint presentation:
//ExStepSummary:1:The following code shows how to create a new Presentation and add a rectangle shape to the first slide:
//ExStepSummary:2:The following code shows how to access the geometry path of the shape:
//ExStepSummary:3:The following code shows how to add line segments to the geometry path:
//ExStepSummary:4:The following code shows how to assign the modified geometry path back to the shape:
//ExStepSummary:5:The following code shows how to save the presentation to disk:

//ExStep:0-
// Define the output file path for the modified presentation
string resultPath = Path.Combine(RunExamples.OutPath, "GeometryShapeAddSegment.pptx");

//ExStep:1-
// Create a new presentation instance
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
    // Add a rectangle shape to the first slide of the presentation
    GeometryShape shape = (GeometryShape)pres.Slides[0].Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, 100, 100, 200, 100);
    
//ExStep:2-
    // Retrieve the geometry path of the newly created shape
    // This allows us to modify the shape's outline
    IGeometryPath geometryPath = shape.GetGeometryPaths()[0];

//ExStep:3-
    // Add two line segments to the geometry path
    // Parameters: x-coordinate, y-coordinate, segment type
    geometryPath.LineTo(100, 50, 1);  // Add first line segment
    geometryPath.LineTo(100, 50, 4);  // Add second line segment

//ExStep:4-
    // Apply the modified geometry path back to the shape
    // This updates the shape's appearance with the new segments
    shape.SetGeometryPath(geometryPath);

//ExStep:5-
    // Save the presentation to the specified output path in PPTX format
    pres.Save(resultPath, SaveFormat.Pptx);
