# Creating Animated Text Effects in PowerPoint with Aspose.Slides

Aspose.Slides for .NET provides powerful capabilities for creating animated text effects in PowerPoint presentations programmatically. This example demonstrates how to create a text box with animation effects, including a custom motion path triggered by a button click. The code creates a presentation with a rectangle shape containing text, applies a PathFootball animation, and adds a custom user-defined motion path that can be triggered interactively.
