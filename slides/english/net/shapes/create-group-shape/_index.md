# Create Group Shapes in PowerPoint with Aspose.Slides

Aspose.Slides for .NET provides comprehensive APIs to create and manipulate PowerPoint presentations programmatically. This example demonstrates how to create a group shape, add multiple rectangle shapes within it, position the shapes properly, add framing, and save the presentation. Group shapes are essential for organizing related shapes that need to be manipulated as a single unit, providing more structure and control over your presentation elements.
