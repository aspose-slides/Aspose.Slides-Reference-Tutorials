// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Instantiate Presentation class 
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())

//ExStep:1-
    // Get the first slide 
    ISlide sld = pres.Slides[0];

//ExStep:2-
    // Accessing the shape collection of slides 
    IShapeCollection slideShapes = sld.Shapes;
