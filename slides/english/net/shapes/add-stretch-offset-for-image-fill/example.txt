//ExStart
//ExSummary:This code demonstrates how to load an image and add it to a PowerPoint presentation slide as a picture frame. It covers creating directories, instantiating a presentation, loading an image file, and saving the modified presentation.
//ExStepSummary:0:The following code sets up the document directory and creates it if it doesn't exist
//ExStepSummary:1:The following code creates a new PowerPoint presentation and accesses the first slide
//ExStepSummary:2:The following code loads an image from file and adds it to the presentation's image collection
//ExStepSummary:3:The following code adds the image as a picture frame to the slide with specific dimensions
//ExStepSummary:4:The following code saves the presentation to disk in PPTX format
//ExStepImage:3:images/1.png

//ExStep:0-
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Create directory if it is not already present.
bool IsExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir);
if (!IsExists)
    System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);

//ExStep:1-
// Instantiate Presentation class that represents the PPTX
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
    // Get the first slide
    ISlide sld = pres.Slides[0];

//ExStep:2-
    // Instantiate the ImageEx class and load the image from file
    IImage img = Images.FromFile(dataDir + "aspose-logo.jpg");
    // Add the loaded image to the presentation's image collection
    IPPImage imgx = pres.Images.AddImage(img);

//ExStep:3-
    // Add Picture Frame with height and width equivalent to the original image
    // Position it at coordinates (50, 150) on the slide
    sld.Shapes.AddPictureFrame(ShapeType.Rectangle, 50, 150, imgx.Width, imgx.Height, imgx);

//ExStep:4-
    // Write the PPTX file to disk
    pres.Save(dataDir + "AddStretchOffsetForImageFill_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
}
//ExEnd
