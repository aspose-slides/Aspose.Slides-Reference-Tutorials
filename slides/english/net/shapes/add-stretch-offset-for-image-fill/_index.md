# Adding Images to PowerPoint Slides with Aspose.Slides

Aspose.Slides for .NET provides powerful capabilities for programmatically creating and modifying PowerPoint presentations. This example demonstrates how to load an external image and add it to a presentation slide as a picture frame - a common requirement when generating reports, creating templates, or building presentations dynamically from data sources.

The code below handles everything from creating a new presentation to adding the image and saving the final PPTX file, all with just a few lines of C# code.
