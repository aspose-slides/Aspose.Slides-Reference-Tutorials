//ExSummary:This code demonstrates how to modify a geometric shape by removing a segment from its geometry path in a PowerPoint presentation. This approach allows for custom shape creation by manipulating existing shape paths.
//ExStepSummary:0:The following code shows how to set up the output file path for the PowerPoint presentation:
//ExStepSummary:1:The following code shows how to create a new presentation and add a heart shape to the first slide:
//ExStepSummary:2:The following code shows how to access the geometry path of the shape:
//ExStepSummary:3:The following code shows how to remove a specific segment from the geometry path:
//ExStepSummary:4:The following code shows how to apply the modified geometry path back to the shape:
//ExStepSummary:5:The following code shows how to save the presentation with the modified shape:

//ExStep:0-
// Output file name
string resultPath = Path.Combine(RunExamples.OutPath, "GeometryShapeRemoveSegment.pptx");

//ExStep:1-
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
    // Create new shape - add a heart shape to the first slide with specified dimensions
    GeometryShape shape = (GeometryShape)pres.Slides[0].Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.Heart, 100, 100, 300, 300);
    
//ExStep:2-
    // Get geometry path of the shape - access the first geometry path of the heart shape
    IGeometryPath path = shape.GetGeometryPaths()[0];
    
//ExStep:3-
    // Remove segment - delete the third segment (index 2) from the geometry path
    path.RemoveAt(2);
    
//ExStep:4-
    // Set new geometry path - apply the modified path back to the shape
    shape.SetGeometryPath(path);
    
//ExStep:5-
    // Save the presentation with the modified shape to the specified path
    pres.Save(resultPath, SaveFormat.Pptx);
