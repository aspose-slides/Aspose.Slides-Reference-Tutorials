//ExStep:0-
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Create directory if it is not already present.
bool IsExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir);
if (!IsExists)
    System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);

//ExStep:1-
// Instantiate PresentationEx class that represents the PPTX
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
//ExStep:2-
    // Get the first slide
    ISlide sld = pres.Slides[0];
    
//ExStep:3-
    // Add autoshape of rectangle type
    IShape shp = sld.Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, 50, 150, 75, 150);
    
//ExStep:4-
    // Rotate the shape to 90 degree
    shp.Rotation = 90;
    
//ExStep:5-
    // Write the PPTX file to disk
    pres.Save(dataDir + "RectShpRot_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
