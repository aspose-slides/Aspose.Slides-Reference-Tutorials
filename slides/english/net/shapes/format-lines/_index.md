# Creating a Rectangle Shape with Custom Line Formatting in PowerPoint

Aspose.Slides for .NET provides powerful capabilities for programmatically creating and modifying PowerPoint presentations. This example demonstrates how to create a rectangle shape with customized line formatting, including setting the line style, width, dash pattern, and color. The sample code creates a new presentation, adds a rectangle to the first slide, and applies specific formatting to both the fill and outline of the shape, resulting in a visually appealing element with a white fill and a blue dashed outline.
