//ExStep:0-
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Create directory if it is not already present.
bool IsExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir);
if (!IsExists)
    System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);

//ExStep:1-
// Instantiate PresentationEx class that represents the PPTX
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
//ExStep:2-
    // Get the first slide
    ISlide sld = pres.Slides[0];

//ExStep:3-
    // Add autoshape of rectangle type
    // Parameters: shape type, X position, Y position, width, height
    IShape shp = sld.Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, 50, 150, 75, 150);

//ExStep:4-
    // Set the fill type to Picture
    shp.FillFormat.FillType = FillType.Picture;

    // Set the picture fill mode to Tile
    shp.FillFormat.PictureFillFormat.PictureFillMode = PictureFillMode.Tile;

//ExStep:5-
    // Load the image from file
    IImage img = Images.FromFile(dataDir + "Tulips.jpg");
    
    // Add the image to presentation's image collection
    IPPImage imgx = pres.Images.AddImage(img);
    
    // Assign the image to the shape's fill
    shp.FillFormat.PictureFillFormat.Picture.Image = imgx;

//ExStep:6-
    // Write the PPTX file to disk
    pres.Save(dataDir + "RectShpPic_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
