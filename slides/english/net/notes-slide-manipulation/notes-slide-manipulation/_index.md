## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

Now, let's get started with each task step by step.

## Task 1: Manage Header and Footer in Notes Slide

using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation(dataDir + "presentation.pptx"))
{
    // Code for managing header and footer
}
```

### Step 3: Change Header and Footer Settings

```csharp
IMasterNotesSlide masterNotesSlide = presentation.MasterNotesSlideManager.MasterNotesSlide;
if (masterNotesSlide != null)
{
    IMasterNotesSlideHeaderFooterManager headerFooterManager = masterNotesSlide.HeaderFooterManager;
    
    // Make header and footer placeholders visible
    headerFooterManager.SetHeaderAndChildHeadersVisibility(true);
    headerFooterManager.SetFooterAndChildFootersVisibility(true);
    headerFooterManager.SetSlideNumberAndChildSlideNumbersVisibility(true);
    headerFooterManager.SetDateTimeAndChildDateTimesVisibility(true);

    // Set text for placeholders
    headerFooterManager.SetHeaderAndChildHeadersText("Header text");
    headerFooterManager.SetFooterAndChildFootersText("Footer text");
    headerFooterManager.SetDateTimeAndChildDateTimesText("Date and time text");
}
```

### Step 4: Save the Presentation

```csharp
presentation.Save(dataDir + "testresult.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
