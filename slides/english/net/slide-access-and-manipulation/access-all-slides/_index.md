## Introduction to Aspose.Slides for .NET

Aspose.Slides for .NET is a robust library that enables developers to create, manipulate, and convert PowerPoint presentations in their .NET applications. It provides a comprehensive set of APIs that allow you to perform various tasks such as creating slides, adding content, and extracting information from presentations.

## Setting Up the Project

Before we begin, make sure you have the Aspose.Slides for .NET library installed in your project. You can download it from the website or use NuGet Package Manager:

```bash
Install-Package Aspose.Slides
```

## Loading a Presentation

To start working with a presentation, you need to load it into your application. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Load the presentation
        using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation("presentation.pptx"))
        {
            // Your code goes here
        }
    }
}
```

## Retrieving All Slides

Once the presentation is loaded, you can easily retrieve all slides using the `Slides` collection. Here's how:

```csharp
// Retrieve all slides
ISlideCollection slides = presentation.Slides;
```

## Accessing Slide Properties

You can access various properties of each slide, such as slide number, slide size, and slide background. Here's an example of how to access the properties of the first slide:

```csharp
// Access the first slide
ISlide firstSlide = slides[0];

// Get slide number
int slideNumber = firstSlide.SlideNumber;

// Get slide size
SizeF slideSize = presentation.SlideSize.Size;

// Get slide background color
Color background = firstSlide.Background.Type == BackgroundType.Solid
    ? ((ISolidFill)firstSlide.Background.FillFormat.SolidFillColor).Color
    : Color.Transparent;
```

## Source Code Walkthrough

Let's walk through the complete source code to retrieve all slides within a presentation:

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;
using System;
using System.Drawing;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Load the presentation
        using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation("presentation.pptx"))
        {
            // Retrieve all slides
            ISlideCollection slides = presentation.Slides;

            // Display slide information
            foreach (ISlide slide in slides)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Slide Number: {slide.SlideNumber}");
                Console.WriteLine($"Slide Size: {presentation.SlideSize.Size}");
                Console.WriteLine($"Background Color: {GetBackgroundColor(slide)}");
                Console.WriteLine();
            }
        }
    }

    static string GetBackgroundColor(ISlide slide)
    {
        Color background = slide.Background.Type == BackgroundType.Solid
            ? ((ISolidFill)slide.Background.FillFormat.SolidFillColor).Color
            : Color.Transparent;

        return background.Name;
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
