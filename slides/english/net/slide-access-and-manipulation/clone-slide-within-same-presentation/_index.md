// Clone the slide
ISlide clonedSlide = presentation.Slides.AddClone(sourceSlide);
```

## Modifying the Cloned Slide

You might want to make some modifications to the cloned slide before saving the presentation. Let's say you want to update the title text of the cloned slide:

```csharp
// Modify the cloned slide's title
IAutoShape titleShape = clonedSlide.Shapes[0] as IAutoShape;
if (titleShape != null)
{
    titleShape.TextFrame.Text = "New Cloned Slide Title";
}
```

## Saving the Presentation

After making the necessary changes, you can save the presentation:

```csharp
// Save the presentation with the cloned slide
presentation.Save("ModifiedPresentation.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

## Running the Code

1. Build your project to ensure there are no errors.
