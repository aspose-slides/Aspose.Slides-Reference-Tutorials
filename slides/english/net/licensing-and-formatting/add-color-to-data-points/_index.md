# Chart Colorization with Aspose.Slides for .NET


In this step-by-step guide, we'll walk you through the process of adding color to data points in a chart using Aspose.Slides for .NET. Aspose.Slides is a powerful library for working with PowerPoint presentations in .NET applications. Adding color to data points in a chart can make your presentations more visually appealing and easier to understand.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Visual Studio: You need Visual Studio installed on your computer.

2. Aspose.Slides for .NET: Download and install Aspose.Slides for .NET from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/net/).

3. A Basic Understanding of C#: You should have a basic knowledge of C# programming.

4. Your Document Directory: Replace "Your Document Directory" in the code with the actual path to your document directory.

## Importing Namespaces

Before you can work with Aspose.Slides for .NET, you need to import the necessary namespaces. 

```csharp
ï»¿using Aspose.Slides.Charts;
using Aspose.Slides.Export;
using Aspose.Slides;
```


In this example, we'll add color to data points in a chart using the Sunburst chart type.

```csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
    // The path to the documents directory.
    string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

    IChart chart = pres.Slides[0].Shapes.AddChart(ChartType.Sunburst, 100, 100, 450, 400);
    
    // Rest of the code will be added in the following steps.
}
```

## Step 1: Accessing Data Points

To add color to specific data points in a chart, you need to access those data points. In this example, we'll target data point 3.

```csharp
IChartDataPointCollection dataPoints = chart.ChartData.Series[0].DataPoints;
dataPoints[3].DataPointLevels[0].Label.DataLabelFormat.ShowValue = true;
```

## Step 2: Customizing Data Labels

Now, let's customize the data labels for data point 0. We'll hide the category name and show the series name.

```csharp
IDataLabel branch1Label = dataPoints[0].DataPointLevels[2].Label;
branch1Label.DataLabelFormat.ShowCategoryName = false;
branch1Label.DataLabelFormat.ShowSeriesName = true;
```

## Step 3: Setting Text Format and Fill Color

We can further enhance the appearance of the data labels by setting the text format and fill color. In this step, we'll set the text color to yellow for data point 0.

```csharp
branch1Label.DataLabelFormat.TextFormat.PortionFormat.FillFormat.FillType = FillType.Solid;
branch1Label.DataLabelFormat.TextFormat.PortionFormat.FillFormat.SolidFillColor.Color = Color.Yellow;
```

## Step 4: Customizing Data Point Fill Color

Now, let's change the fill color of data point 9. We'll set it to a specific color.

```csharp
IFormat steam4Format = dataPoints[9].Format;
steam4Format.Fill.FillType = FillType.Solid;
steam4Format.Fill.SolidFillColor.Color = Color.FromArgb(0, 176, 240, 255);
```

## Step 5: Saving the Presentation

After customizing the chart, you can save the presentation with the changes.

```csharp
pres.Save(dataDir + "AddColorToDataPoints.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

Congratulations! You've successfully added color to data points in a chart using Aspose.Slides for .NET. This can greatly enhance the visual appeal and clarity of your presentations.

Adding color to data points in a chart is a powerful way to make your presentations more engaging and informative. With Aspose.Slides for .NET, you have the tools to create visually appealing charts that convey your data effectively.
