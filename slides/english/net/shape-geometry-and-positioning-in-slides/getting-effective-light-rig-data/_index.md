## Introduction
Creating dynamic and visually appealing presentation slides is a common requirement in today's digital era. One essential aspect is manipulating the light rig properties to enhance the overall aesthetics. This tutorial will guide you through the process of obtaining effective light rig data in presentation slides using Aspose.Slides for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following:
- Basic knowledge of C# and .NET programming.
- Aspose.Slides for .NET library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/net/).
- A code editor such as Visual Studio.
## Import Namespaces
In your C# code, ensure that you import the necessary namespaces to work with Aspose.Slides:
```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;
using Aspose.Slides.Examples.CSharp;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Your Project
Begin by creating a new C# project in your preferred development environment. Make sure to include the Aspose.Slides library in your project references.
## Step 2: Define Your Document Directory
Set the path to your document directory in the C# code:
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
bool isExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir);
if (!isExists)
    System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);
```
## Step 3: Load the Presentation
Use the following code to load a presentation file:
```csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir + "Presentation1.pptx"))
{
    // Your code for retrieving effective light rig data goes here
}
```
## Step 4: Retrieve Effective Light Rig Data
Now, let's obtain the effective light rig data from the presentation:
```csharp
IThreeDFormatEffectiveData threeDEffectiveData = pres.Slides[0].Shapes[0].ThreeDFormat.GetEffective();
Console.WriteLine("= Effective light rig properties =");
Console.WriteLine("Type: " + threeDEffectiveData.LightRig.LightType);
Console.WriteLine("Direction: " + threeDEffectiveData.LightRig.Direction);
```
## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to get effective light rig data in presentation slides using Aspose.Slides for .NET. Experiment with different settings to achieve the desired visual effects in your presentations.
