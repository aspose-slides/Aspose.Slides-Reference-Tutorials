## Introduction
Aspose.Slides for .NET is a powerful library that facilitates working with PowerPoint presentations in the .NET environment. If you want to enhance your presentations by formatting rectangle shapes dynamically, this tutorial is for you. In this step-by-step guide, we will walk you through the process of formatting a rectangle shape in a presentation using Aspose.Slides for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- A development environment with Aspose.Slides for .NET installed.
- Basic knowledge of C# programming language.
- Familiarity with creating and manipulating PowerPoint presentations.
Now, let's get started with the tutorial!
## Import Namespaces
In your C# code, you need to import the necessary namespaces to use Aspose.Slides functionalities. Add the following namespaces at the beginning of your code:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Slides;
using System.Drawing;
```
## Step 1: Set up Your Document Directory
Begin by setting up the directory where you want to save your PowerPoint presentation file. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your directory.
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
bool IsExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir);
if (!IsExists)
    System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);
```
## Step 2: Create a Presentation Object
Instantiate the `Presentation` class to represent the PPTX file. This will be the foundation for your PowerPoint presentation.
```csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
    // Your code goes here
}
```
## Step 3: Get the First Slide
Access the first slide in your presentation, as it will be the canvas where you add and format the rectangle shape.
```csharp
ISlide sld = pres.Slides[0];
```
## Step 4: Add a Rectangle Shape
Use the `Shapes` property of the slide to add an auto shape of rectangle type. Specify the position and dimensions of the rectangle.
```csharp
IShape shp = sld.Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, 50, 150, 150, 50);
```
## Step 5: Apply Formatting to the Rectangle Shape
Now, let's apply some formatting to the rectangle shape. Set the fill color, line color, and width of the shape to customize its appearance.
```csharp
shp.FillFormat.FillType = FillType.Solid;
shp.FillFormat.SolidFillColor.Color = Color.Chocolate;
shp.LineFormat.FillFormat.FillType = FillType.Solid;
shp.LineFormat.FillFormat.SolidFillColor.Color = Color.Black;
shp.LineFormat.Width = 5;
```
## Step 6: Save the Presentation
Write the modified presentation to disk using the `Save` method, specifying the file format as PPTX.
```csharp
pres.Save(dataDir + "RectShp2_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
Congratulations! You've successfully formatted a rectangle shape in a presentation using Aspose.Slides for .NET.
