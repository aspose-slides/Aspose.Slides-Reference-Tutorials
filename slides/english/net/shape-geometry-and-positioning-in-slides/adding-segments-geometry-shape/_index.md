# Mastering Visuals - Adding Segments with Aspose.Slides in .NET

## Introduction
In the world of .NET development, creating visually appealing presentations is a common requirement. Aspose.Slides for .NET is a powerful library that facilitates seamless integration of robust presentation creation capabilities into your .NET applications. This tutorial focuses on a specific aspect of presentation design â€“ adding segments to geometry shapes.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Basic knowledge of C# programming language.
- Visual Studio installed on your machine.
- Aspose.Slides for .NET library downloaded and referenced in your project.
## Import Namespaces
In your C# code, make sure to import the necessary namespaces to access the Aspose.Slides functionalities. Add the following lines to your code:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Slides;
using Aspose.Slides.Export;
```
Now, let's break down the example into multiple steps.
## Step 1: Set Up Your Project
Start by creating a new C# project in Visual Studio. Ensure that you have the Aspose.Slides library referenced in your project.
## Step 2: Create a Presentation
Initialize a new presentation object using the Aspose.Slides library. This will serve as the canvas for your geometry shape.
```csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
    // Your code for creating a presentation goes here
}
```
## Step 3: Add a Geometry Shape
Create a geometry shape within the presentation. For example, let's add a rectangle to the first slide.
```csharp
GeometryShape shape = (GeometryShape)pres.Slides[0].Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, 100, 100, 200, 100);
```
## Step 4: Get Geometry Path
Retrieve the geometry path of the created shape to manipulate its segments.
```csharp
IGeometryPath geometryPath = shape.GetGeometryPaths()[0];
```
## Step 5: Add Segments
Add segments (lines) to the geometry path. In this example, two lines are added to the path.
```csharp
geometryPath.LineTo(100, 50, 1);
geometryPath.LineTo(100, 50, 4);
```
## Step 6: Assign Edited Geometry Path
Assign the modified geometry path back to the shape to apply the changes.
```csharp
shape.SetGeometryPath(geometryPath);
```
## Step 7: Save the Presentation
Save the modified presentation to a desired location.
```csharp
pres.Save(resultPath, SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
With these steps, you've successfully added segments to a geometry shape in a presentation using Aspose.Slides for .NET.
## Conclusion
Aspose.Slides for .NET empowers developers to enhance their applications with advanced presentation creation capabilities. Adding segments to geometry shapes provides a means to customize the visual elements of your presentations.
