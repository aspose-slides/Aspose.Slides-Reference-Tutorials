## Introduction
In the dynamic landscape of presentations, incorporating multimedia elements can elevate the overall impact and engagement. Adding video frames to your slides can be a game-changer, capturing your audience's attention in a way static content can't. Aspose.Slides for .NET provides a robust solution for seamlessly integrating video frames into your presentation slides.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Basic understanding of C# and .NET programming.
- Aspose.Slides for .NET library installed. If not, you can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/net/).
- A suitable development environment set up.
## Import Namespaces
To get started, make sure you import the necessary namespaces into your project:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Slides;
using Aspose.Slides.Export;
```
## Step 1: Create Presentation Object
Begin by creating an instance of the `Presentation` class, representing the PPTX file:
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
    // Your code here
}
```
## Step 2: Access the Slide
Retrieve the first slide from the presentation:
```csharp
ISlide sld = pres.Slides[0];
```
## Step 3: Add Video Frame
Now, add a video frame to the slide:
```csharp
IVideoFrame vf = sld.Shapes.AddVideoFrame(50, 150, 300, 150, dataDir + "video1.avi");
```
Adjust the parameters (left, top, width, height) according to your layout preferences.
## Step 4: Set Play Mode and Volume
Configure the play mode and volume of the inserted video frame:
```csharp
vf.PlayMode = VideoPlayModePreset.Auto;
vf.Volume = AudioVolumeMode.Loud;
```
Feel free to customize these settings based on your presentation requirements.
## Step 5: Save the Presentation
Save the modified presentation to disk:
```csharp
pres.Save(dataDir + "VideoFrame_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
Now, your presentation includes a seamlessly integrated video frame!
