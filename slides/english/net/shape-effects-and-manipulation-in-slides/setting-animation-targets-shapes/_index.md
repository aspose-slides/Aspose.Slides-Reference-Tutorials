# Mastering Animation Targets with Aspose.Slides for .NET

## Introduction
In the dynamic world of presentations, adding animations to your slides can be a game-changer. Aspose.Slides for .NET empowers developers to create engaging and visually appealing presentations by allowing precise control over animation targets for slide shapes. In this step-by-step guide, we'll walk you through the process of setting animation targets using Aspose.Slides for .NET. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, this tutorial will help you harness the power of animations in your presentations.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Aspose.Slides for .NET Library: Download and install the library from the [Aspose.Slides for .NET documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/slides/net/).
- Development Environment: Ensure you have a working .NET development environment set up on your machine.
## Import Namespaces
In your .NET project, include the necessary namespaces to access the Aspose.Slides functionalities. Add the following code snippet to your project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Slides;
using Aspose.Slides.Animation;
using Aspose.Slides.DOM.Ole;
using Aspose.Slides.Export;
```
## Step 1: Create a Presentation Instance
Start by creating an instance of the Presentation class, representing the PPTX file. Make sure to set the path to your document directory.
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
bool isExists = Directory.Exists(dataDir);
if (!isExists)
    Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);
string presentationFileName = Path.Combine(dataDir, "AnimationShapesExample.pptx");
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation(presentationFileName))
{
    // Your code for further actions goes here
}
```
## Step 2: Iterate Through Slides and Animation Effects
Now, iterate through each slide in the presentation and inspect the animation effects associated with each shape. This code snippet demonstrates how to achieve this:
```csharp
foreach (ISlide slide in pres.Slides)
{
    foreach (IEffect effect in slide.Timeline.MainSequence)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(effect.Type + " animation effect is set to shape#" +
                          effect.TargetShape.UniqueId +
                          " on slide#" + slide.SlideNumber);
    }
}
```
