## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of .NET programming.
- Installed Visual Studio or any preferred .NET development environment.
- Aspose.Slides for .NET library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/net/).
## Import Namespaces
In your .NET project, start by importing the necessary namespaces to access Aspose.Slides functionality:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Slides;
using Aspose.Slides.Export;
```
## Step 1: Set up the Document Directory
Begin by defining the path to your document directory:
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
bool isExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir);
if (!isExists)
    System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);
```
## Step 2: Instantiate the PresentationEx Class
Create an instance of the `Presentation` class, representing the PPTX file:
```csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
    // Your code for the next steps will go here.
}
```
## Step 3: Get the First Slide
Access the first slide of the presentation:
```csharp
ISlide sld = pres.Slides[0];
```
## Step 4: Add an Autoshape Line
Add a line autoshape to the slide:
```csharp
sld.Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.Line, 50, 150, 300, 0);
```
Adjust the parameters (left, top, width, height) based on your requirements.
## Step 5: Save the Presentation
Save the modified presentation to disk:
```csharp
pres.Save(dataDir + "LineShape1_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
