# Shape Animations Made Easy with Aspose.Slides

## Introduction
In the world of dynamic presentations, adding animations to shapes can significantly enhance the visual appeal and engagement of your slides. Aspose.Slides for .NET provides a powerful toolkit to achieve this seamlessly. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of applying animations to shapes using Aspose.Slides, allowing you to create captivating presentations that leave a lasting impression.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following in place:
1. Aspose.Slides for .NET: Ensure you have the library installed and ready to use. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/net/).
2. Development Environment: Set up your preferred development environment with the necessary configurations.
3. Document Directory: Create a directory to store your presentation files.
## Import Namespaces
In your .NET application, start by importing the required namespaces:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Slides;
using Aspose.Slides.Export;
using Aspose.Slides.Animation;
using System.Drawing;
```
## Step 1: Create a Presentation
Begin by creating a new presentation using the `Presentation` class:
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
bool IsExists = System.IO.Directory.Exists(dataDir);
if (!IsExists)
    System.IO.Directory.CreateDirectory(dataDir);
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
    // Your code for creating a presentation goes here.
}
```
## Step 2: Add Animated Shape
Now, let's add an animated shape to the first slide of your presentation:
```csharp
ISlide sld = pres.Slides[0];
IAutoShape ashp = sld.Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, 150, 150, 250, 25);
ashp.AddTextFrame("Animated TextBox");
```
## Step 3: Apply Animation Effect
Add the 'PathFootball' animation effect to the created shape:
```csharp
pres.Slides[0].Timeline.MainSequence.AddEffect(ashp, EffectType.PathFootball, EffectSubtype.None, EffectTriggerType.AfterPrevious);
```
## Step 4: Create Trigger Button
Create a button that will trigger the animation:
```csharp
IShape shapeTrigger = pres.Slides[0].Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.Bevel, 10, 10, 20, 20);
```
## Step 5: Define Custom User Path
Define a custom user path for the animation:
```csharp
ISequence seqInter = pres.Slides[0].Timeline.InteractiveSequences.Add(shapeTrigger);
IEffect fxUserPath = seqInter.AddEffect(ashp, EffectType.PathUser, EffectSubtype.None, EffectTriggerType.OnClick);
IMotionEffect motionBhv = ((IMotionEffect)fxUserPath.Behaviors[0]);
PointF[] pts = new PointF[1];
pts[0] = new PointF(0.076f, 0.59f);
motionBhv.Path.Add(MotionCommandPathType.LineTo, pts, MotionPathPointsType.Auto, true);
pts[0] = new PointF(-0.076f, -0.59f);
motionBhv.Path.Add(MotionCommandPathType.LineTo, pts, MotionPathPointsType.Auto, false);
motionBhv.Path.Add(MotionCommandPathType.End, null, MotionPathPointsType.Auto, false);
// Save the presentation as PPTX to disk
pres.Save(dataDir + "AnimExample_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
This completes the step-by-step guide for applying animations to shapes using Aspose.Slides for .NET.
