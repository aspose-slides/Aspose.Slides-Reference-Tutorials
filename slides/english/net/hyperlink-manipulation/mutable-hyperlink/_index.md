# Mutable Hyperlink Creation in Aspose.Slides for .NET


In the world of modern software development, creating dynamic presentations with interactive hyperlinks is crucial for engaging your audience. Aspose.Slides for .NET is a powerful tool that allows you to manipulate and customize PowerPoint presentations, including the creation of mutable hyperlinks. In this step-by-step guide, we will walk you through the process of creating mutable hyperlinks using Aspose.Slides for .NET. 

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the world of mutable hyperlinks, there are a few prerequisites you need to have in place:

### 1. Aspose.Slides for .NET
Ensure that you have Aspose.Slides for .NET installed and set up in your development environment. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/net/).

### 2. .NET Framework
Make sure you have the .NET Framework installed on your machine. Aspose.Slides for .NET requires the .NET Framework to function.

### 3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
You'll need an IDE such as Visual Studio to write and execute .NET code.

Now that you have the necessary prerequisites in place, let's move on to creating mutable hyperlinks in Aspose.Slides for .NET.

## Mutable Hyperlink Creation

### Step 1: Setting up your Project
First, create a new project or open an existing one in your IDE. Make sure you have Aspose.Slides for .NET correctly referenced in your project.

### Step 2: Import Namespaces
In your code file, import the necessary namespaces for working with Aspose.Slides:

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;
using Aspose.Slides.Export;
using Aspose.Slides.Shape;
```

### Step 3: Create a New Presentation
To create a new PowerPoint presentation, use the following code:

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation())
{
    // Your code for creating and manipulating the presentation goes here
    presentation.Save(dataDir + "presentation-out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
}
```

### Step 4: Adding a Hyperlinked Shape
Now, let's add a shape to your presentation with a hyperlink. In this example, we'll create a rectangle shape with a hyperlink to the Aspose website:

```csharp
IAutoShape shape1 = presentation.Slides[0].Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, 100, 100, 600, 50, false);
shape1.AddTextFrame("Aspose: File Format APIs");
shape1.TextFrame.Paragraphs[0].Portions[0].PortionFormat.HyperlinkClick = new Hyperlink("https://www.aspose.com/");
shape1.TextFrame.Paragraphs[0].Portions[0].PortionFormat.HyperlinkClick.Tooltip = "More than 70% Fortune 100 companies trust Aspose APIs";
shape1.TextFrame.Paragraphs[0].Portions[0].PortionFormat.FontHeight = 32;
```

In this step, we've added a rectangular shape with the text "Aspose: File Format APIs" and a clickable hyperlink. You can customize the shape, text, and hyperlink according to your needs.

### Step 5: Saving the Presentation
Finally, save your presentation to a file using the following code:

```csharp
presentation.Save(dataDir + "presentation-out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

Your mutable hyperlink presentation is now ready!
