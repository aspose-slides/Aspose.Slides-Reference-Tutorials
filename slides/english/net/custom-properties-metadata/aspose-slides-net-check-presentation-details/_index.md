# How to Use Aspose.Slides .NET to Check Presentation Created or Modified Details

## Introduction

Have you ever needed to verify which application created a PowerPoint presentation, or determine its version? This is especially useful in environments where presentations are shared and modified across different platforms. With Aspose.Slides for .NET, you can easily retrieve this information with precision. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the steps of implementing a solution that checks the application name and version used to create or modify a PowerPoint presentation (.pptx) using Aspose.Slides for .NET.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to set up your environment with Aspose.Slides for .NET
- The method to retrieve document properties from a PPTX file
- Extracting application name and version information

Before diving into the implementation, let's ensure you have everything needed to follow along smoothly.

## Prerequisites

To get started, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

### Required Libraries, Versions, and Dependencies:
- Aspose.Slides for .NET (latest version)
- Basic understanding of C# programming
- .NET Core or .NET Framework development environment set up

### Environment Setup Requirements:
- Visual Studio 2019 or later installed on your machine
- Basic familiarity with using the .NET CLI or Package Manager Console

## Setting Up Aspose.Slides for .NET

To begin, you need to integrate Aspose.Slides into your project. This library is crucial for accessing and manipulating PowerPoint presentations.

### Installation:

**Using .NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Slides
```

**Package Manager Console:**
```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.Slides
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:**
1. Open the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio.
2. Search for "Aspose.Slides".
3. Select and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition:

Aspose offers a free trial with limited features, which is perfect for testing. You can acquire a temporary license to unlock full capabilities or purchase a subscription if you need it long-term. Visit [Aspose's Purchase Page](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy) for more details on licensing options.

### Basic Initialization and Setup:

Once installed, initialize Aspose.Slides within your project by including the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;
using System.IO;
```

## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the implementation into manageable sections to ensure clarity and ease of understanding.

### Check Presentation Created or Modified Details

This feature allows you to extract metadata about who created or last modified a presentation, including the application name and version.

#### Overview:
You will retrieve information stored within the PPTX file properties using Aspose.Slides' `PresentationFactory` class. This is particularly useful for auditing purposes or maintaining consistency across documents in your workflow.

##### Step 1: Set Up Your Document Directory

Start by defining the path to where your document resides:
```csharp
// Define the directory path, ensuring it points to your presentation file
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
```

Replace `"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"` with the actual folder path containing your `props.pptx` file.

##### Step 2: Load the Presentation

Combine the directory path and the filename to locate your presentation:
```csharp
// Combine paths to access 'props.pptx' in your document directory
string presentationPath = Path.Combine(dataDir, "props.pptx");
```

Ensure `props.pptx` exists within this directory before proceeding.

##### Step 3: Retrieve Presentation Info

Use the `PresentationFactory` class to gather information about the presentation:
```csharp
// Access presentation details using Aspose.Slides
IPresentationInfo info = PresentationFactory.Instance.GetPresentationInfo(presentationPath);
```

This step is crucial as it initializes the process of reading document properties.

##### Step 4: Read Document Properties

Extract the necessary properties such as application name and version:
```csharp
// Retrieve document properties from the presentation
documentProperties props = info.ReadDocumentProperties();

// Extract and store the application's name
string app = props.NameOfApplication;

// Extract and store the application's version used for modification
string ver = props.AppVersion;
```

These steps retrieve metadata that can be logged or displayed as needed.

#### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure file paths are correctly specified to avoid `FileNotFoundException`.
- Verify permissions on the directory if you encounter access issues.
- Double-check that your Aspose.Slides package is up-to-date for compatibility with newer PPTX versions.

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world scenarios where checking presentation details can be beneficial:

1. **Auditing and Compliance:** Track document modifications to ensure compliance with organizational policies.
2. **Version Control Systems:** Integrate with version control systems to log changes made using different software.
3. **Collaboration Tools:** Use within collaborative platforms to verify the origin of shared documents.
4. **Security Applications:** Monitor unauthorized changes or modifications to sensitive presentations.

## Performance Considerations

When working with large presentations or numerous files, consider these optimization tips:
- Limit memory usage by processing one presentation at a time if possible.
- Dispose of `IDisposable` objects properly to free resources.
- Use asynchronous programming for handling multiple file operations simultaneously.
