## Implementation Guide

With our environment set up, let's modify PowerPoint presentation properties using Aspose.Slides for .NET.

### Accessing Presentation Properties

#### Overview
Access and modify built-in properties of a PowerPoint file:

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Slides;

// Define your document directories
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

// Instantiate the Presentation class
Presentation presentation = new Presentation(dataDir + "/ModifyBuiltinProperties.pptx");

// Access built-in properties
IDocumentProperties documentProperties = presentation.DocumentProperties;
```

#### Explanation
- **`dataDir`**: Path to your input PowerPoint file.
- **`outputDir`**: Directory where the modified presentation will be saved.

### Modifying Built-In Properties
Set various properties as follows:

**Author:**
```csharp
documentProperties.Author = "Aspose.Slides for .NET";
```
- Sets the author of the presentation.

**Title:**
```csharp
documentProperties.Title = "Modifying Presentation Properties with Aspose.Slides";
```
- Updates the title of your presentation.

**Subject, Comments, and Manager:**
```csharp
documentProperties.Subject = "Aspose Subject";
documentProperties.Comments = "Aspose Description";
documentProperties.Manager = "Aspose Manager";
```
- These properties provide additional metadata about the document.

### Saving Changes
Save your modifications with:

```csharp
presentation.Save(outputDir + "/DocumentProperties_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

## Practical Applications

1. **Automating Office Workflows**: Automate bulk updates to presentation metadata.
2. **Document Management Systems**: Integrate with systems tracking document versions and authorship.
