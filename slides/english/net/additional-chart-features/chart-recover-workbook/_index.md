## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

### 1. Aspose.Slides for .NET

You should have Aspose.Slides for .NET installed and set up in your .NET development environment. If you haven't already, you can download and install it from the website.

### 2. PowerPoint Presentation

You'll need a PowerPoint presentation with a chart from which you want to recover the workbook. Ensure that you have the presentation file ready.

## Importing Necessary Namespaces

In this step, you'll need to import the required namespaces to work with Aspose.Slides for .NET effectively.

### Step 1: Import Namespaces

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;
using Aspose.Slides.Charts;
using Aspose.Slides.Export;
```

Now, let's break down the process of recovering a workbook from a chart within a PowerPoint presentation into multiple steps.

## Step 1: Define the Document Directory

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

In this step, you need to specify the directory where your PowerPoint presentation is located.

## Step 2: Load the Presentation and Enable Workbook Recovery

```csharp
string pptxFile = Path.Combine(dataDir, "YourPresentation.pptx");
string outPptxFile = Path.Combine(RunExamples.OutPath, "RecoveredWorkbook.pptx");

LoadOptions lo = new LoadOptions();
lo.SpreadsheetOptions.RecoverWorkbookFromChartCache = true;

using (Presentation pres = new Presentation(pptxFile, lo))
{
    // Your code for chart recovery goes here
    pres.Save(outPptxFile, SaveFormat.Pptx);
}
```

In this step, you load the PowerPoint presentation from the specified file and enable workbook recovery from the chart cache. The `LoadOptions` object is used for this purpose.

## Step 3: Access and Work with the Chart Data

```csharp
IChart chart = pres.Slides[0].Shapes[0] as IChart;
IChartDataWorkbook wb = chart.ChartData.ChartDataWorkbook;
```

In this step, you access the chart on the first slide and obtain the chart data workbook. You can now work with the workbook data as needed.
