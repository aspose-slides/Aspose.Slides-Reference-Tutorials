# How to Create & Customize Charts with Aspose.Slides .NET: Display Percentages as Labels

## Introduction

Presenting data effectively is crucial in many fields, and charts play a vital role by turning complex information into clear visuals. Creating the perfect chart involves customization tasks like displaying percentages on labels—a task made easier with Aspose.Slides for .NET. This library simplifies the process of creating and modifying charts within PowerPoint presentations.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use Aspose.Slides for .NET to create a stacked column chart from scratch and customize it by displaying percentage values as data labels. By following these steps, you’ll enhance your slides with precise and visually appealing data representations.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Initializing Aspose.Slides for .NET
- Creating a stacked column chart
- Calculating and displaying percentages on data labels
- Optimizing chart performance best practices

Before we dive into implementation, let's ensure you have everything ready to get started.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial effectively, make sure you have:
- **.NET Core SDK** installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of C# and .NET application development.
- Visual Studio or a similar IDE for writing and running C# code.

You'll need Aspose.Slides for .NET to create charts, so ensure it's set up as described below.

## Setting Up Aspose.Slides for .NET

Aspose.Slides for .NET is a powerful library that allows you to work with PowerPoint presentations programmatically. Here’s how to add it to your project:

### Installation

**.NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Slides
```

**Package Manager Console:**
```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.Slides
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:** 
- Open NuGet Package Manager and search for "Aspose.Slides". Install the latest version.

### License Acquisition

To fully utilize Aspose.Slides, start with a free trial. For extended use, consider acquiring a temporary license or purchasing one from [Aspose](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy). Follow their guidelines to set up your license in your project environment.

### Basic Initialization

Once installed, initialize the `Presentation` class to begin creating slides:
```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;

// Initialize Presentation class instance
tPresentation presentation = new Presentation();
```

Now, let's move on to implementing our chart creation and customization feature using Aspose.Slides for .NET.

## Implementation Guide

### Create a Stacked Column Chart

Our goal is to create a stacked column chart and customize it by showing percentages as data labels. Here’s how:

#### Initialize the Presentation

Start by creating an instance of `Presentation`:
```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;

// Initialize Presentation class instance
tPresentation presentation = new Presentation();
ISlide slide = presentation.Slides[0];
```

#### Add a Chart to the Slide

Add a stacked column chart to your first slide at specified coordinates and dimensions:
```csharp
IChart chart = slide.Shapes.AddChart(ChartType.StackedColumn, 20, 20, 400, 400);
```
This line creates a `StackedColumn` chart at position (20, 20) with width and height of 400.

#### Calculate Total Values for Percentage Calculation

To display percentages, calculate the total value for each category across all series:
```csharp
IChartSeries series;
double[] total_for_Cat = new double[chart.ChartData.Categories.Count];

for (int k = 0; k < chart.ChartData.Categories.Count; k++)
{
    IChartCategory cat = chart.ChartData.Categories[k];
    // Sum up values of all series for each category
    for (int i = 0; i < chart.ChartData.Series.Count; i++)
    {
        total_for_Cat[k] += Convert.ToDouble(chart.ChartData.Series[i].DataPoints[k].Value.Data);
    }
}
```

#### Customize Data Labels to Show Percentage Values

Next, iterate through each series and customize the data labels:
```csharp
for (int x = 0; x < chart.ChartData.Series.Count; x++)
{
    series = chart.ChartData.Series[x];
    series.Labels.DefaultDataLabelFormat.ShowLegendKey = false;

    for (int j = 0; j < series.DataPoints.Count; j++)
    {
        IDataLabel lbl = series.DataPoints[j].Label;
        
        // Calculate percentage
        double dataPontPercent = (Convert.ToDouble(series.DataPoints[j].Value.Data) / total_for_Cat[j]) * 100;
        IPortion port = new Portion();
        port.Text = String.Format("{0:F2} %", dataPontPercent);
        port.PortionFormat.FontHeight = 8f;

        lbl.TextFrameForOverriding.Text = ""; // Clear text to avoid overlap
        IParagraph para = lbl.TextFrameForOverriding.Paragraphs[0];
        para.Portions.Add(port);

        // Configure label format to hide default data labels
        lbl.DataLabelFormat.ShowSeriesName = false;
        lbl.DataLabelFormat.ShowPercentage = false; 
        lbl.DataLabelFormat.ShowLegendKey = false;
        lbl.DataLabelFormat.ShowCategoryName = false;
        lbl.DataLabelFormat.ShowBubbleSize = false;
    }
}
```

This section calculates the percentage for each data point and sets it as a custom label, ensuring no overlap with default labels.

#### Save the Presentation

Finally, save your presentation to view the result:
```csharp
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
presentation.Save(outputDir + "/DisplayPercentageAsLabels_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

## Practical Applications

Displaying percentages in charts can be particularly useful in scenarios like:
1. **Financial Reporting:** Show portfolio distributions or investment returns as percentages.
2. **Sales Analysis:** Represent market share data by percentage to highlight performance across regions.
3. **Survey Results:** Display survey responses as percentages for better visual comparison.
4. **Project Management:** Use pie charts with percentages to illustrate resource allocation.
5. **Education:** Explain statistical concepts using clear percentage-based visuals.

Integrating these customized charts into systems like CRM or ERP can enhance dashboards and reports, aiding decision-making processes.

## Performance Considerations

When working with Aspose.Slides for .NET, especially with large datasets:
- **Memory Management:** Dispose of presentation objects properly to free up memory. Use `using` statements where applicable.
- **Efficient Data Handling:** Perform calculations outside loops when possible to reduce computational overhead.
- **Load Balancing:** For web applications, ensure server resources are adequately provisioned for concurrent chart generation requests.

## Conclusion

This tutorial covered creating and customizing charts using Aspose.Slides for .NET by displaying percentage values as labels. Mastering these techniques allows you to enhance your presentations with detailed and visually appealing data representations.

As a next step, explore other chart types and customization options available in Aspose.Slides. Experiment with different datasets to transform them into powerful visuals that communicate insights clearly.
