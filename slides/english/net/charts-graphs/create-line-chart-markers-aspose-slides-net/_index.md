# How to Create a Line Chart with Markers in C# Using Aspose.Slides for .NET

## Introduction
Creating visually appealing and informative line charts is essential for effective data presentation in C#. **Aspose.Slides for .NET** simplifies the process of adding professional-looking charts, including those with markers. This tutorial will guide you through creating a line chart with default markers using Aspose.Slides for .NET.

In this tutorial, you'll learn:
- Setting up your environment to use Aspose.Slides for .NET.
- Creating and customizing a presentation with a line chart that includes markers.
- Configuring chart properties such as categories, series, and data points.
- Saving the final presentation file.

Let's start by reviewing the prerequisites needed before implementing our solution.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- **Required Libraries:** Aspose.Slides for .NET installed in your development environment via NuGet.
- **Environment Setup Requirements:** A working C# development environment like Visual Studio and the .NET framework installed on your machine.
- **Knowledge Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of C# programming and familiarity with creating presentations programmatically.

## Setting Up Aspose.Slides for .NET
### Installation Information
To begin using Aspose.Slides for .NET, add it to your project via one of the following methods:

**Using .NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Slides
```

**Via Package Manager Console in Visual Studio:**
```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.Slides
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:**
- Open your solution in Visual Studio.
- Go to "Manage NuGet Packages for Solution..."
- Search for "Aspose.Slides" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition
Before using Aspose.Slides, obtain a trial or purchase license:
1. **Free Trial:** Visit [Aspose's Free Trial page](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/net/) to start quickly.
2. **Temporary License:** For extended access, visit the [Temporary License Page](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).
3. **Purchase:** To use Aspose.Slides in production, purchase a license at [Aspose Purchase](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy).

### Basic Initialization
After setting up your project and obtaining necessary licenses, initialize Aspose.Slides as follows:
```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;
// Create an instance of Presentation class
Presentation pres = new Presentation();
```
Now that we've set up our environment, let's proceed to create a line chart with markers.

## Implementation Guide
### Creating the Line Chart with Markers
In this section, you'll learn each step needed to create and configure a line chart with default markers in your presentation using Aspose.Slides for .NET.

#### Step 1: Create a Presentation Object
Start by creating an instance of the `Presentation` class:
```csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
    ISlide slide = pres.Slides[0];
```
Here, we access the first slide in a newly created presentation.

#### Step 2: Add a Line Chart with Markers
Next, add a line chart with markers to your slide:
```csharp
IChart chart = slide.Shapes.AddChart(ChartType.LineWithMarkers, 10, 10, 400, 400);
```
This code adds a new chart of type `LineWithMarkers` at coordinates `(10, 10)` with dimensions `400x400`.

#### Step 3: Clear Existing Series and Categories
Before adding data, clear any existing series or categories:
```csharp
chart.ChartData.Series.Clear();
chart.ChartData.Categories.Clear();
```
This ensures our chart starts with a clean slate.

#### Step 4: Configure Chart Data Workbook
Access the `ChartDataWorkbook` to manage your chart's data:
```csharp
IChartDataWorkbook fact = chart.ChartData.ChartDataWorkbook;
```
This object is crucial for managing cells containing series and category data.

#### Step 5: Add Series and Categories
Add a new series to the chart and populate it with data points:
```csharp
chart.ChartData.Series.Add(fact.GetCell(0, 0, 1, "Series 1"), chart.Type);
IChartSeries series = chart.ChartData.Series[0];

// Define categories and corresponding data points
chart.ChartData.Categories.Add(fact.GetCell(0, 1, 0, "C1"));
series.DataPoints.AddDataPointForLineSeries(fact.GetCell(0, 1, 1, 24));
chart.ChartData.Categories.Add(fact.GetCell(0, 2, 0, "C2"));
series.DataPoints.AddDataPointForLineSeries(fact.GetCell(0, 2, 1, 23));
chart.ChartData.Categories.Add(fact.GetCell(0, 3, 0, "C3"));
series.DataPoints.AddDataPointForLineSeries(fact.GetCell(0, 3, 1, -10));
chart.ChartData.Categories.Add(fact.GetCell(0, 4, 0, "C4"));

// Add a null data point to demonstrate handling of missing values
series.DataPoints.AddDataPointForLineSeries(fact.GetCell(0, 4, 1, (double?)null));
```
Here, we populate the chart with categories and corresponding series data. Notice how a `null` value is handled as a demonstration.

#### Step 6: Add Another Series
Repeat the process to add another series:
```csharp
chart.ChartData.Series.Add(fact.GetCell(0, 0, 2, "Series 2"), chart.Type);
IChartSeries series2 = chart.ChartData.Series[1];

series2.DataPoints.AddDataPointForLineSeries(fact.GetCell(0, 1, 2, 30));
series2.DataPoints.AddDataPointForLineSeries(fact.GetCell(0, 2, 2, 10));
series2.DataPoints.AddDataPointForLineSeries(fact.GetCell(0, 3, 2, 60));
series2.DataPoints.AddDataPointForLineSeries(fact.GetCell(0, 4, 2, 40));
```

#### Step 7: Enable and Configure the Legend
Enable the chart legend to improve readability:
```csharp
chart.HasLegend = true;
chart.Legend.Overlay = false;
```
This ensures that the legend is visible and not overlaid on the chart.

#### Step 8: Save the Presentation
Finally, save your presentation with the newly added chart:
```csharp
pres.Save("DefaultMarkersInChart.pptx");
}
```
### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Data Binding Errors:** Ensure data points correspond to categories correctly.
- **Chart Not Displaying:** Verify that `chart.HasLegend` and other properties are set appropriately.

## Practical Applications
1. **Business Reports:** Use line charts with markers for tracking sales performance over time, showing trends in monthly revenue.
2. **Financial Analysis:** Visualize stock price movements with default markers to highlight peaks and troughs.
3. **Scientific Research:** Present experimental results where data points need clear demarcation for analysis.

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize by limiting the number of data series and categories when dealing with large datasets.
- Use memory management techniques like disposing objects promptly in .NET to reduce resource usage.
