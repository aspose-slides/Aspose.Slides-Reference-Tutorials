using Aspose.Slides.Charts;
```

## Implementation Guide

Let’s walk through setting up a custom date format for category axes.

### 1. Create and Configure Chart

#### Overview

We’ll start by adding a chart to your presentation slide and configuring it to display dates in the desired format.

#### Add and Configure the Chart

```csharp
// Define the directory for document storage
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Define the directory for document storage
        string dataDir = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";

        using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
        {
            // Add a chart to the first slide with specific dimensions
            IChart chart = pres.Slides[0].Shapes.AddChart(ChartType.Area, 50, 50, 450, 300);
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Access and Modify Chart Data

#### Overview

We’ll modify the chart data workbook to insert date values as categories.

#### Clear Existing Categories and Series

```csharp
// Access the chart data workbook for manipulation
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
        {
            IChart chart = pres.Slides[0].Shapes.AddChart(ChartType.Area, 50, 50, 450, 300);
            IChartDataWorkbook wb = chart.ChartData.ChartDataWorkbook;

            // Clear existing categories and series in the chart data
            chart.ChartData.Categories.Clear();
            chart.ChartData.Series.Clear();
        }
    }
}
```

#### Add Date Values as New Categories

Use this snippet to insert dates:

```csharp
// Access the chart data workbook for manipulation
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
        {
            IChart chart = pres.Slides[0].Shapes.AddChart(ChartType.Area, 50, 50, 450, 300);
            IChartDataWorkbook wb = chart.ChartData.ChartDataWorkbook;

            // Add date values as new categories to the chart
            chart.ChartData.Categories.Add(wb.GetCell(0, "A2", DateTime.Now.AddDays(-30)));
            chart.ChartData.Categories.Add(wb.GetCell(0, "A3", DateTime.Now));
            chart.ChartData.Categories.Add(wb.GetCell(0, "A4", DateTime.Now.AddDays(30)));

            // Add a series and populate it with data
            IChartSeries series = chart.ChartData.Series.Add(wb.GetCell(0, "B1", "Sample Series"), chart.Type);
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Set Custom Date Format

#### Overview

Now, configure the category axis to display dates in your preferred format.

#### Configure Category Axis

```csharp
// Access the category axis and set custom date format
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
        {
            IChart chart = pres.Slides[0].Shapes.AddChart(ChartType.Area, 50, 50, 450, 300);
            IChartDataWorkbook wb = chart.ChartData.ChartDataWorkbook;

            // Add date values as new categories to the chart
            chart.ChartData.Categories.Add(wb.GetCell(0, "A2", DateTime.Now.AddDays(-30)));
            chart.ChartData.Categories.Add(wb.GetCell(0, "A3", DateTime.Now));
            chart.ChartData.Categories.Add(wb.GetCell(0, "A4", DateTime.Now.AddDays(30)));

            // Add a series and populate it with data
            IChartSeries series = chart.ChartData.Series.Add(wb.GetCell(0, "B1", "Sample Series"), chart.Type);

            // Access the category axis and set custom date format
            IAxis categoryAxis = chart.Axes.HorizontalAxis;
            categoryAxis.MajorUnit = 1; // Set major unit as days
            categoryAxis.NumberFormat.FormatCode = "dd-MMM"; // Custom format: day-month abbreviation

            // Save the presentation with changes
            pres.Save(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\FormattedChart.pptx", Aspose.Slides.Export.SaveFormat.Pptx);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Parameters and Methods Explanation
- **MajorUnit**: Sets the interval for major ticks on the axis.
- **NumberFormat.FormatCode**: Defines how dates are displayed. The format `"dd-MMM"` displays day and month abbreviation.

### Troubleshooting Tips

1. Ensure your Aspose.Slides license is correctly set up to avoid limitations in functionality.
2. Verify date values and formats, especially when dealing with different locales or regional settings.
