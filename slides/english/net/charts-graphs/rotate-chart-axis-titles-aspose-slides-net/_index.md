Start by creating a new presentation and adding a clustered column chart.
```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;

string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";

// Initialize a new Presentation instance.
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
{
    // Add a clustered column chart to the first slide at position (50, 50) with width 450 and height 300.
    IChart chart = pres.Slides[0].Shapes.AddChart(ChartType.ClusteredColumn, 50, 50, 450, 300);
```
#### Step 2: Enable Vertical Axis Title
Enable the vertical axis title to customize its appearance.
```csharp
    // Enable the vertical axis title for the chart.
    chart.Axes.VerticalAxis.HasTitle = true;
```
#### Step 3: Set Rotation Angle
Set the rotation angle of the text block format for the vertical axis title.
```csharp
    // Set the rotation angle to 90 degrees.
    chart.Axes.VerticalAxis.Title.TextFormat.TextBlockFormat.RotationAngle = 90;

    // Save the presentation with the modified chart to a .pptx file in the specified directory.
    pres.Save(dataDir + "test.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
}
```
