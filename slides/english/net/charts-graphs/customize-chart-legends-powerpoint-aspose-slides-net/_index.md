## Implementation Guide
### Setting Custom Legend Options for a Chart
Customizing chart legends allows you to tailor presentations according to specific needs, enhancing clarity and design.

#### Overview:
This feature focuses on customizing the legend’s position and dimensions within a chart in PowerPoint using Aspose.Slides for .NET.

#### Implementation Steps:
**Step 1: Create an Instance of Presentation Class**
```csharp
// Define your document directory
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
Presentation presentation = new Presentation();
```

**Step 2: Access the First Slide**
```csharp
ISlide slide = presentation.Slides[0];
```

**Step 3: Add a Clustered Column Chart to the Slide**
```csharp
IChart chart = slide.Shapes.AddChart(ChartType.ClusteredColumn, 50, 50, 500, 500);
```
*Explanation:* This snippet adds a clustered column chart at specified coordinates on the slide.

**Step 4: Set Legend Properties**
```csharp
// Configure legend's position relative to chart dimensions
chart.Legend.X = 50 / chart.Width;
chart.Legend.Y = 50 / chart.Height;
// Define width and height as percentage of chart size
chart.Legend.Width = 100 / chart.Width;
chart.Legend.Height = 100 / chart.Height;
```
*Why this matters:* Adjusting the legend’s position ensures it fits well within your presentation layout.

**Step 5: Save Your Presentation**
```csharp
presentation.Save(dataDir + "Legend_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

### Creating a Presentation and Adding Shapes

        // Initialize a new Presentation instance
        Presentation presentation = new Presentation();
    }
}
```

**Step 2: Access the First Slide**
```csharp
ISlide slide = presentation.Slides[0];
```

**Step 3: Add Shapes to the Slide**
```csharp
// Example of adding a rectangle shape
IShape rectangle = slide.Shapes.AddAutoShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, 150, 75, 150, 50);
```
*Explanation:* This code snippet adds a rectangular shape at specified coordinates on your first slide.

**Step 4: Save the Presentation**
