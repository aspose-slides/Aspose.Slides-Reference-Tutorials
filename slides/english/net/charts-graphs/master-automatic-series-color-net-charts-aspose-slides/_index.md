```
Set up by creating an instance of `Presentation`.

## Implementation Guide
This section details implementing automatic series fill color with Aspose.Slides for .NET, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding.

### Adding a Clustered Column Chart with Automatic Series Fill Color
#### Overview
Create a clustered column chart in your presentation, configuring it to automatically determine series colors for enhanced aesthetics and efficiency.

#### Step 1: Create a New Presentation
Initialize a new `Presentation` object:
```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;
using Aspose.Slides.Charts;
// Specify your document directory path
cstring dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation()) {
    // Proceed to add a chart in the next steps...
}
```

#### Step 2: Add a Clustered Column Chart
Add a clustered column chart at position (100, 50) with dimensions (600x400):
```csharp
// Add a clustered column chart\IChart chart = presentation.Slides[0].Shapes.AddChart(ChartType.ClusteredColumn, 100, 50, 600, 400);
```

#### Step 3: Configure Automatic Series Color
Iterate through each series to enable automatic color filling:
```csharp
// Loop over each series for automatic color setting
type IChartSeries series;
for (int i = 0; i < chart.ChartData.Series.Count; i++) {
    series = chart.ChartData.Series[i];
    // Set the series' color automatically
    series.Format.Fill.FillType = FillType.Solid;
    series.Format.Fill.SolidFillColor.Color = Color.FromArgb(255, GetRandomColor());
}
```
#### Step 4: Save Your Presentation
Save the presentation with the new chart configuration:
```csharp
// Save in PPTX format\presentation.Save(dataDir + "AutoFillSeries_out.pptx\
