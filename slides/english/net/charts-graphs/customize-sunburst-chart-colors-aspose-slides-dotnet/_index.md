```

## Implementation Guide

This section covers how to customize color for data points in a sunburst chart using Aspose.Slides.

### Adding a Sunburst Chart

Start by creating a presentation and adding a sunburst chart:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Drawing;
using Aspose.Slides;
using Aspose.Slides.Charts;

public class AddColorToDataPointsFeature
{
    public static void Run() {
        using (Presentation pres = new Presentation())
        {
            string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
            IChart chart = pres.Slides[0].Shapes.AddChart(ChartType.Sunburst, 100, 100, 450, 400);
```

### Customizing Data Point Colors

#### Show Value Labels for Specific Data Points

Make specific data point values visible to enhance clarity:

```csharp
            IChartDataPointCollection dataPoints = chart.ChartData.Series[0].DataPoints;
            dataPoints[3].DataPointLevels[0].Label.DataLabelFormat.ShowValue = true;
```

#### Customize Label Appearance

Customize labels for better visual representation by setting the label format and color:

```csharp
            IDataLabel branch1Label = dataPoints[0].DataPointLevels[2].Label;
            branch1Label.DataLabelFormat.ShowCategoryName = false;  
            branch1Label.DataLabelFormat.ShowSeriesName = true;

            branch1Label.DataLabelFormat.TextFormat.PortionFormat.FillFormat.FillType = FillType.Solid;
            branch1Label.DataLabelFormat.TextFormat.PortionFormat.FillFormat.SolidFillColor.Color = Color.Yellow;
```

#### Set Specific Data Point Colors

Apply specific colors to individual data points for visual emphasis:

```csharp
            IFormat steam4Format = dataPoints[9].Format;
            steam4Format.Fill.FillType = FillType.Solid;
            steam4Format.Fill.SolidFillColor.Color = Color.FromArgb(0, 176, 240, 255);
```

### Saving the Presentation

Finally, save your presentation to a specified directory:

```csharp
            pres.Save(outputDir + "AddColorToDataPoints.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
        }
    }
}
```

## Practical Applications

Customizing sunburst charts with Aspose.Slides for .NET can be applied in various scenarios:
