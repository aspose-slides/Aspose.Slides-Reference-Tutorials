### Knowledge Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of C# programming
- Familiarity with handling files in a .NET environment
- Conceptual knowledge of PowerPoint charts

## Setting Up Aspose.Slides for .NET

Follow these steps to set up your project using Aspose.Slides for .NET:

```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Slides
```

### Installation via Package Manager Console

Execute this command in the NuGet Package Manager Console:
```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.Slides
```

### Installation via NuGet Package Manager UI

- Open your project in Visual Studio.
- Navigate to **Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Manage NuGet Packages for Solution**.

## Implementation Guide

With your environment set up, follow these steps to change font properties in chart texts:

### Step 1: Load an Existing Presentation File

Load a presentation file from the directory where you want to apply changes:
```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with your document path
string filePath = Path.Combine(dataDir, "test.pptx");
```
**Explanation**: This code sets up the file path for loading your existing PowerPoint presentation.

### Step 2: Open the Presentation

Open the presentation using Aspose.Slides:
```csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation(filePath))
{
    // Subsequent steps will be nested within this block
}
```
**Explanation**: The `Presentation` class handles opening and manipulating your PowerPoint file. Using a `using` statement ensures resources are properly disposed of.

### Step 3: Add a Clustered Column Chart

Add a clustered column chart to the first slide:
```csharp
IChart chart = pres.Slides[0].Shapes.AddChart(ChartType.ClusteredColumn, 50, 50, 600, 400);
```
**Explanation**: This step creates a new clustered column chart at specified coordinates and dimensions.

### Step 4: Enable the Data Table Display

Ensure that the data table is visible within the chart:
```csharp
chart.HasDataTable = true;
```
**Explanation**: Setting `HasDataTable` to true makes sure that data labels are displayed, which we will customize next.

### Step 5: Set Font Properties for Chart Text

Customize the font properties such as boldness and height for your chart's data table text:
```csharp
chart.ChartDataTable.TextFormat.PortionFormat.FontBold = NullableBool.True; // Make text bold
chart.ChartDataTable.TextFormat.PortionFormat.FontHeight = 20; // Set font height to 20 points
```
**Explanation**: These lines adjust the visual style of your chart's data labels, making them more prominent and readable.

### Step 6: Save the Modified Presentation

Finally, save the presentation with the changes:
```csharp
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with your output path
string outputPath = Path.Combine(outputDir, "output.pptx");
pres.Save(outputPath, SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
**Explanation**: This step writes the updated presentation to a new file in your specified directory.

## Practical Applications

Customizing chart texts can be beneficial in numerous scenarios:
1. **Business Reports**: Enhance readability and professionalism of financial charts.
2. **Educational Presentations**: Make data tables clearer for students and educators.
3. **Marketing Slideshows**: Boost visual appeal in product presentations.
4. **Research Documents**: Highlight key findings with styled chart labels.
5. **Dashboard Interfaces**: Improve user experience in analytical software.

## Performance Considerations

When working with Aspose.Slides, consider these performance tips:
- **Optimize Data Handling**: Only load and process slides or charts that need modification.
- **Efficient Resource Use**: Dispose of objects promptly to free memory.
- **Batch Processing**: If handling multiple presentations, batch operations can save processing time.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you've learned how to set font properties for chart texts in PowerPoint using Aspose.Slides for .NET. By following these steps, you can enhance the clarity and impact of your charts significantly.

Next steps could include exploring other customization features like color schemes or integrating Aspose.Slides with cloud services for broader application deployment.
