### Adding a PieOfPie Chart to Your Presentation

#### Overview

This section shows how to create and add a PieOfPie chart to your PowerPoint slide using Aspose.Slides.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

**1. Initialize the Presentation**

Create an instance of the `Presentation` class:

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;

Presentation presentation = new Presentation();
```

**2. Add a PieOfPie Chart**

Insert the chart at your desired position and dimensions on the first slide:

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides.Charts;

IChart chart = presentation.Slides[0].Shapes.AddChart(ChartType.PieOfPie, 50, 50, 500, 400);
```

**3. Save Your Presentation**

Save your file in PPTX format after adding the chart:

```csharp

```

### Configuring Chart Data Labels and Series Group Properties

#### Overview

Enhance your chart by configuring data labels and series group properties for better visualization.

**1. Set Data Label Format**

Display values on the first series:

```csharp
chart.ChartData.Series[0].Labels.DefaultDataLabelFormat.ShowValue = true;
