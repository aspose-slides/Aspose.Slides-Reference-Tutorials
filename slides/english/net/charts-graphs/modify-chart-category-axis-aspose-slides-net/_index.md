## Implementation Guide

### Change Chart Category Axis to Date
This feature allows you to modify the category axis type of your chart, ideal for time-series data.

#### Overview
We’ll change the category axis of an existing chart in a PowerPoint presentation to date format and configure its major unit settings. This adjustment will make timelines clearer and more intuitive for viewers.

#### Steps:

**Step 1: Load Your Presentation**
Load an existing presentation containing the chart you wish to modify.
```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation(dataDir + "/ExistingChart.pptx"))
{
    // Accessing the first shape on the first slide and casting it to IChart
    IChart chart = presentation.Slides[0].Shapes[0] as IChart;
```

**Step 2: Modify Category Axis Type**
Change the category axis type to `Date`, ideal for datasets with chronological data.
```csharp
    // Change the category axis type to Date
    chart.Axes.HorizontalAxis.CategoryAxisType = CategoryAxisType.Date;
```

**Step 3: Configure Major Unit Settings**
Set manual controls over major gridline intervals, enhancing clarity and precision in your presentation.
```csharp
    // Configure major unit settings on the horizontal axis
    chart.Axes.HorizontalAxis.IsAutomaticMajorUnit = false; 
    chart.Axes.HorizontalAxis.MajorUnit = 1;
    chart.Axes.HorizontalAxis.MajorUnitScale = TimeUnitType.Months;
```

**Step 4: Save Your Changes**
Finally, save your presentation with the modified chart to a new file.
```csharp
    // Save the updated presentation
    presentation.Save(dataDir + "/ChangeChartCategoryAxis_out.pptx\
