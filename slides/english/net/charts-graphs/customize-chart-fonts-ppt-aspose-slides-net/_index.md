dotnet add package Aspose.Slides
```

**Using Package Manager:**

### Implementation Guide
Let's break down the implementation into manageable sections.

#### Customizing Font Properties for Charts
This feature allows you to enhance the visual appeal of your charts by adjusting font properties. Here’s how to implement it:

**Step 1: Define Directory Paths**
Start by specifying where your input and output files will be located:
```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputPath = Path.Combine(dataDir, "FontPropertiesForChart.pptx");
```

**Step 2: Create a New Presentation Instance**
Initialize a new presentation object to host your chart:
```csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation()) {
    // Further steps will be implemented here.
}
```

**Step 3: Add a Clustered Column Chart**
Insert a chart into the first slide at specified coordinates and dimensions:
```csharp
IChart chart = pres.Slides[0].Shapes.AddChart(ChartType.ClusteredColumn, 100, 100, 500, 400);
```

**Step 4: Set Font Height for Text in Chart**
Customize the font size to improve readability:
```csharp
chart.TextFormat.PortionFormat.FontHeight = 20;
```

**Step 5: Enable Displaying Values on Data Labels**
Ensure data values are visible, adding context to your chart:
```csharp
chart.ChartData.Series[0].Labels.DefaultDataLabelFormat.ShowValue = true;
```

**Step 6: Save the Presentation**
Save your presentation with all customizations applied:
```csharp
pres.Save(outputPath, SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

### Practical Applications
- **Business Reports**: Customize chart fonts to highlight key metrics in financial presentations.
- **Academic Presentations**: Enhance lecture slides by making data labels and titles more prominent.
- **Marketing Materials**: Use visually appealing charts to present sales trends or market analysis.

Integration with other systems can streamline workflows, allowing for automated chart generation from databases or spreadsheets.

### Performance Considerations
To ensure your application runs smoothly:
- Optimize resource usage by disposing of objects appropriately using `using` statements.
- Manage memory efficiently by limiting the scope of variables and cleaning up unused resources.
- Follow best practices for .NET memory management to prevent leaks when working with Aspose.Slides.
