# Add Scatter Charts to Presentations Using Aspose.Slides .NET: A Step-by-Step Guide

## Introduction
Are you looking to enhance your presentations by integrating scatter charts effortlessly? With the power of Aspose.Slides for .NET, creating and customizing charts becomes a breeze. This tutorial will guide you through adding scatter charts to your slides using Aspose.Slides for .NET. By mastering these techniques, you'll present data more effectively and create visually appealing presentations.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Setting up Aspose.Slides for .NET in your project
- Creating a new presentation and accessing its first slide
- Adding scatter charts with smooth lines to slides
- Clearing existing series and adding new ones to charts
- Modifying data points and marker styles for enhanced visualization
- Saving the presentation to a specified directory

Let's start by reviewing the prerequisites.

## Prerequisites
Before implementing Aspose.Slides for .NET, ensure you have the following:
- **Aspose.Slides for .NET Library**: Version 23.7 or later.
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio 2019 or newer with .NET Framework 4.6.1+ or .NET Core/5+.
- **Basic C# Knowledge**: Familiarity with object-oriented programming in C#.

## Setting Up Aspose.Slides for .NET
To start using Aspose.Slides, you need to install the library in your project. Here's how:

**Using .NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Slides
```

**Using Package Manager Console:**
```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.Slides
```

**NuGet Package Manager UI:**
- Search for "Aspose.Slides" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition
You can start with a free trial or apply for a temporary license to explore all features. To purchase, follow these steps:
1. Visit [Purchase Aspose.Slides](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy) to buy a full license.
2. For a temporary license, visit [Temporary License Page](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/).

Once you've obtained your license file, add it to your project using:
```csharp
Aspose.Slides.License license = new Aspose.Slides.License();
license.SetLicense("Aspose.Slides.lic");
```

## Implementation Guide
We'll break down the implementation into logical sections based on features.

### Create Presentation and Add Slide
This section demonstrates how to create a presentation and access its first slide.

#### Overview
Start by creating an instance of the `Presentation` class, which represents your PowerPoint file. Accessing slides is straightforward using this object model.

#### Implementation Steps
**Step 1: Initialize Presentation**
```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;

// Create a new presentation
t Presentation pres = new Presentation();
```
This code initializes a new presentation document.

**Step 2: Access First Slide**
```csharp
// Access the first slide in the presentation
ISlide slide = pres.Slides[0];
```
Here, `pres.Slides[0]` accesses the very first slide. 

### Add Scatter Chart to Slide
Now let's add a scatter chart to your presentation.

#### Overview
Adding charts can help you represent data visually in presentations. Aspose.Slides makes it simple to incorporate various types of charts, including scatter plots.

#### Implementation Steps
**Step 1: Create and Add Scatter Chart**
```csharp
using Aspose.Slides.Charts;

// Create and add a default scatter chart with smooth lines
IChart chart = slide.Shapes.AddChart(ChartType.ScatterWithSmoothLines, 0, 0, 400, 400);
```
This snippet adds a scatter chart at the specified position and size.

### Clear and Add Series to Chart Data
#### Overview
You might need to customize your chart by clearing existing series and adding new ones. This section covers that functionality.

#### Implementation Steps
**Step 1: Access Chart Data Workbook**
```csharp
int defaultWorksheetIndex = 0;
IChartDataWorkbook fact = chart.ChartData.ChartDataWorkbook;

// Clear any pre-existing series
chart.ChartData.Series.Clear();
```
This code clears existing data to start fresh with new series.

**Step 2: Add New Series**
```csharp
// Add a new series named "Series 1"
chart.ChartData.Series.Add(fact.GetCell(defaultWorksheetIndex, 1, 1, "Series 1"), chart.Type);

// Add another series named "Series 2"
chart.ChartData.Series.Add(fact.GetCell(defaultWorksheetIndex, 1, 3, "Series 2"), chart.Type);
```
These steps add two new series to the chart.

### Modify First Series Data Points and Marker Style
#### Overview
Customize data points and marker styles for better visualization of your scatter plots.

#### Implementation Steps
**Step 1: Access and Add Data Points**
```csharp
IChartSeries series = chart.ChartData.Series[0];

// Add data points (1, 3) and (2, 10)
series.DataPoints.AddDataPointForScatterSeries(fact.GetCell(defaultWorksheetIndex, 2, 1, 1), fact.GetCell(defaultWorksheetIndex, 2, 2, 3));
series.DataPoints.AddDataPointForScatterSeries(fact.GetCell(defaultWorksheetIndex, 3, 1, 2), fact.GetCell(defaultWorksheetIndex, 3, 2, 10));
```
**Step 2: Modify Marker Style**
```csharp
// Change the series type and modify marker style
series.Type = ChartType.ScatterWithStraightLinesAndMarkers;
series.Marker.Size = 10;
series.Marker.Symbol = MarkerStyleType.Star;
```
### Modify Second Series Data Points and Marker Style
#### Overview
Similarly, customize the second series to tailor your presentation needs.

#### Implementation Steps
**Step 1: Access and Add Multiple Data Points**
```csharp
// Access the second chart series
series = chart.ChartData.Series[1];

// Add multiple data points
series.DataPoints.AddDataPointForScatterSeries(fact.GetCell(defaultWorksheetIndex, 2, 3, 5), fact.GetCell(defaultWorksheetIndex, 2, 4, 2));
series.DataPoints.AddDataPointForScatterSeries(fact.GetCell(defaultWorksheetIndex, 3, 3, 3), fact.GetCell(defaultWorksheetIndex, 3, 4, 1));
series.DataPoints.AddDataPointForScatterSeries(fact.GetCell(defaultWorksheetIndex, 4, 3, 2), fact.GetCell(defaultWorksheetIndex, 4, 4, 2));
series.DataPoints.AddDataPointForScatterSeries(fact.GetCell(defaultWorksheetIndex, 5, 3, 5), fact.GetCell(defaultWorksheetIndex, 5, 4, 1));
```
**Step 2: Modify Marker Style**
```csharp
// Change marker size and symbol for the second series
series.Marker.Size = 10;
series.Marker.Symbol = MarkerStyleType.Circle;
```
### Save Presentation
Finally, save your presentation to a specified directory.

#### Implementation Steps
**Step 1: Define Directory**
Ensure that the output directory exists. If not, create it:
```csharp
using Aspose.Slides.Export;
using System.IO;

string YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
bool isExists = Directory.Exists(YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY);
if (!isExists) 
    Directory.CreateDirectory(YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY);

// Save the presentation
pres.Save(YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY + "\AsposeChart_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
This code saves your presentation file to a specified location.

## Conclusion
You have now successfully added scatter charts to your presentations using Aspose.Slides for .NET. Continue exploring additional features and customizations available within the library to enhance your data visualization skills.
