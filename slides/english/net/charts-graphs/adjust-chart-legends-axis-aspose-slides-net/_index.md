### Adjust Legend Font Size
Adjusting the legend font size enhances readability. Here’s how to do it:

#### Overview
We’ll modify a chart's legend text font size using Aspose.Slides for .NET.

#### Steps
**1. Load Your Presentation:**
Start by loading your PowerPoint file where you want to adjust the chart legends.
```csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir))
{
    // Access the first slide and add a clustered column chart.
    IChart chart = pres.Slides[0].Shapes.AddChart(ChartType.ClusteredColumn, 50, 50, 600, 400);
```

**2. Set Legend Font Size:**
Specify the desired font height for better visibility.
```csharp
    // Adjust the font size of the legend text to 20.
    chart.Legend.TextFormat.PortionFormat.FontHeight = 20;
}
```
- **Explanation:** `FontHeight` sets the size in points, enhancing readability.

**3. Save Your Presentation:**
After making changes, save your presentation to preserve them.
```csharp
pres.Save(outputDir, Aspose.Slides.Export.SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

### Configure Vertical Axis Min and Max Values
Customizing axis values allows for precise data representation.

#### Overview
Learn how to set specific minimum and maximum values for the vertical axis of your chart.

#### Steps
**1. Load Your Presentation:**
As before, open the presentation containing your chart.
```csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir))
{
    IChart chart = pres.Slides[0].Shapes.AddChart(ChartType.ClusteredColumn, 50, 50, 600, 400);
```

**2. Set Custom Axis Values:**
Disable automatic axis value settings and define your own.
```csharp
    // Disable auto-min for the vertical axis.
    chart.Axes.VerticalAxis.IsAutomaticMinValue = false;
    // Set a custom minimum value of -5.
    chart.Axes.VerticalAxis.MinValue = -5;

    // Similarly, disable auto-max and set to 10.
    chart.Axes.VerticalAxis.IsAutomaticMaxValue = false;
    chart.Axes.VerticalAxis.MaxValue = 10;
}
```
- **Explanation:** Customizing these values allows for tailored data scaling.

**3. Save Your Presentation:**
Ensure your changes are saved by writing back to the file.
```csharp
pres.Save(outputDir, Aspose.Slides.Export.SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world scenarios where adjusting chart legends and axis values is particularly beneficial:
1. **Financial Reports:** Customize charts for clarity when presenting quarterly earnings with negative growth indicators.
2. **Academic Presentations:** Adjust font sizes in graphs to ensure readability during lectures or seminars.
3. **Marketing Analytics:** Highlight key performance metrics by setting specific axis ranges on sales data charts.
