**What You'll Learn:**
- How to create a new presentation using Aspose.Slides
- Adding and configuring line charts with custom image markers
- Efficiently managing chart data series and sizes
- Saving the enhanced presentation

Let's dive into how you can elevate your PowerPoint charts with just a few lines of code.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:
- **Aspose.Slides for .NET**: A leading library that simplifies PowerPoint automation.
- **.NET Environment**: Your development machine should be set up with either .NET Core or .NET Framework.
- **Basic C# Knowledge**: Familiarity with object-oriented programming concepts is helpful.

## Setting Up Aspose.Slides for .NET

### Installation

To begin, you'll need to install Aspose.Slides. Depending on your development environment, choose one of the following methods:

**Using .NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.Slides
```

**Via Package Manager Console:**
```powershell
Install-Package Aspose.Slides
```

**Through NuGet Package Manager UI:**
- Search for "Aspose.Slides" and install the latest version.

### License Acquisition

To get started, you can:
- **Free Trial**: Download a trial license to test features.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for more extensive testing.
- **Purchase**: Buy a full license for commercial use.

After acquiring your license, initialize Aspose.Slides as follows:

```csharp
// Load the license if you have one
var license = new Aspose.Slides.License();
license.SetLicense("Aspose.Slides.lic");
```

## Implementation Guide

### Create and Configure Presentation

#### Overview
Start by creating a presentation instance which will serve as your base for adding charts.

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;

// Initialize a new presentation
Presentation presentation = new Presentation();
```

This snippet creates an empty PowerPoint file, ready to be filled with data-rich visuals.

### Add Chart to Slide

#### Overview
Add a line chart with markers to the first slide of your presentation.

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides.Charts;

// Access the first slide
ISlide slide = presentation.Slides[0];

// Add a line chart with markers
IChart chart = slide.Shapes.AddChart(ChartType.LineWithMarkers, 0, 0, 400, 400);
```

This code snippet introduces a new chart to your slide, laying the groundwork for data visualization.

### Configure Chart Data

#### Overview
Set up the data for your chart by clearing existing series and adding new ones.

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides.Charts;

// Get the workbook used by the chart's data
int defaultWorksheetIndex = 0;
IChartDataWorkbook fact = chart.ChartData.ChartDataWorkbook;

// Clear any existing series
chart.ChartData.Series.Clear();

// Add a new series to the chart
chart.ChartData.Series.Add(fact.GetCell(defaultWorksheetIndex, 1, 1, "Series 1"), chart.Type);
```

This configuration allows you to customize your data points and series names.

### Add Images as Markers

#### Overview
Replace default markers with images to create a visually appealing representation of data points.

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;
using System.Drawing;

// Load images from files
IImage image1 = Images.FromFile("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/aspose-logo.jpg");
IPPImage imgx1 = presentation.Images.AddImage(image1);
IImage image2 = Images.FromFile("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Tulips.jpg");
IPPImage imgx2 = presentation.Images.AddImage(image2);

// Access the first series in the chart
IChartSeries series = chart.ChartData.Series[0];

// Add data points with images as markers
IChartDataPoint point1 = series.DataPoints.AddDataPointForLineSeries(fact.GetCell(defaultWorksheetIndex, 1, 1, (double)4.5));
point1.Marker.Format.Fill.FillType = FillType.Picture;
point1.Marker.Format.Fill.PictureFillFormat.Picture.Image = imgx1;

IChartDataPoint point2 = series.DataPoints.AddDataPointForLineSeries(fact.GetCell(defaultWorksheetIndex, 2, 1, (double)2.5));
point2.Marker.Format.Fill.FillType = FillType.Picture;
point2.Marker.Format.Fill.PictureFillFormat.Picture.Image = imgx2;

IChartDataPoint point3 = series.DataPoints.AddDataPointForLineSeries(fact.GetCell(defaultWorksheetIndex, 3, 1, (double)3.5));
point3.Marker.Format.Fill.FillType = FillType.Picture;
point3.Marker.Format.Fill.PictureFillFormat.Picture.Image = imgx1;

IChartDataPoint point4 = series.DataPoints.AddDataPointForLineSeries(fact.GetCell(defaultWorksheetIndex, 4, 1, (double)4.5));
point4.Marker.Format.Fill.FillType = FillType.Picture;
point4.Marker.Format.Fill.PictureFillFormat.Picture.Image = imgx2;
```

This snippet illustrates how to visually customize data points using images.

### Configure Series Marker Size

#### Overview
Adjust the marker size for better visibility and impact.

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides.Charts;

// Set marker size
series.Marker.Size = 15;
```

This setting ensures your markers are distinct and easy to spot on the chart.

### Save Presentation

#### Overview
Save your changes to a new PowerPoint file.

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides.Export;

// Save the presentation with all modifications
presentation.Save("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/MarkOptions_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

This command finalizes your work by writing it to disk in the specified format.
