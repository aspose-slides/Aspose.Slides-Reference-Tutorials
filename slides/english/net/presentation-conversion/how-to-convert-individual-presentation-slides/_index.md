# How to Convert Individual Presentation Slides


## Introduction of Aspose.Slides for .NET

Aspose.Slides for .NET is a feature-rich library that enables developers to work with PowerPoint presentations programmatically. It provides an extensive set of classes and methods that allow you to create, manipulate, and convert presentation files in various formats.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.Slides for .NET: Make sure you have Aspose.Slides for .NET installed and configured in your development environment. You can download it from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/net/).

- Presentation File: You'll need a PowerPoint presentation file (PPTX) containing the slides you want to convert. Ensure you have the necessary presentation file ready.

- Code Editor: Use your preferred code editor to implement the provided source code. Any code editor that supports C# will suffice.

## Setting up the Environment
Let's start by setting up your development environment to prepare your project for converting individual slides. Follow these steps:

1. Open your code editor and create a new project or open an existing one where you want to implement the slide conversion functionality.

2. Add a reference to the Aspose.Slides for .NET library in your project. You can typically do this by right-clicking on your project in the Solution Explorer, selecting "Add," and then "Reference." Browse to the Aspose.Slides DLL file you downloaded earlier and add it as a reference.

3. You're now ready to integrate the provided source code into your project. Ensure you have the source code ready for the next step.

## Loading the Presentation
The first section of the code focuses on loading the PowerPoint presentation. This step is essential for accessing and working with the slides within the presentation.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation(dataDir + "Individual-Slide.pptx"))
{
    // Code for slide conversion goes here
}
```

Ensure you replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual directory path where your presentation file is located.

## HTML Conversion Options
This part of the code discusses HTML conversion options. You'll learn how to customize these options to match your requirements.

```csharp
HtmlOptions htmlOptions = new HtmlOptions();
htmlOptions.HtmlFormatter = HtmlFormatter.CreateCustomFormatter(new CustomFormattingController());
INotesCommentsLayoutingOptions notesOptions = htmlOptions.NotesCommentsLayouting;
notesOptions.NotesPosition = NotesPositions.BottomFull;
```

Customize these options to control the formatting and layout of your converted HTML slides.

## Looping Through Slides
In this section, we explain how to loop through each slide in the presentation to ensure every slide is processed.

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < presentation.Slides.Count; i++)
{
    // Code for saving slides as HTML goes here
}
```

This loop iterates through all the slides in the presentation.

## Saving as HTML
The final part of the code deals with saving each slide as an individual HTML file.

```csharp
presentation.Save(dataDir + "Individual Slide" + (i + 1) + "_out.html", new[] { i + 1 }, SaveFormat.Html, htmlOptions);
```

Here, the code saves each slide as an HTML file with a unique name based on the slide number.

## Step 5: Custom Formatting (Optional)
If you wish to apply custom formatting to your HTML output, you can use the `CustomFormattingController` class. This section allows you to control the formatting of individual slides.
```csharp
public class CustomFormattingController : IHtmlFormattingController
        {
            void IHtmlFormattingController.WriteDocumentStart(IHtmlGenerator generator, IPresentation presentation)
            {}

            void IHtmlFormattingController.WriteDocumentEnd(IHtmlGenerator generator, IPresentation presentation)
            {}

            void IHtmlFormattingController.WriteSlideStart(IHtmlGenerator generator, ISlide slide)
            {
                generator.AddHtml(string.Format(SlideHeader, generator.SlideIndex + 1));
            }

            void IHtmlFormattingController.WriteSlideEnd(IHtmlGenerator generator, ISlide slide)
            {
                generator.AddHtml(SlideFooter);
            }

            void IHtmlFormattingController.WriteShapeStart(IHtmlGenerator generator, IShape shape)
            {}

            void IHtmlFormattingController.WriteShapeEnd(IHtmlGenerator generator, IShape shape)
            {}

            private const string SlideHeader = "<div class=\"slide\" name=\"slide\" id=\"slide{0}\">";
            private const string SlideFooter = "</div>";
        }
```

## Error Handling

Error handling is important to ensure your application handles exceptions gracefully. You can use try-catch blocks to handle potential exceptions that might occur during the conversion process.
