# Convert Presentation to PDF with Progress Update


In today's digital age, converting presentations to PDF is a common requirement, especially in the business and educational sectors. Aspose.Slides for .NET provides a powerful solution for accomplishing this task with ease. In this step-by-step tutorial, we will guide you through the process of converting a presentation to PDF while keeping track of the conversion progress.

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will utilize Aspose.Slides for .NET to convert a PowerPoint presentation to a PDF document. We'll also implement a progress update feature to keep you informed about the conversion's status.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Visual Studio or any preferred code editor.
2. Aspose.Slides for .NET library installed.
3. A PowerPoint presentation file to convert (e.g., "ConvertToPDF.pptx").

## Step 1: Setting up the Environment

First, create a new C# project in Visual Studio or your preferred code editor. Ensure that you have added a reference to the Aspose.Slides for .NET library in your project.

## Step 2: Writing the Code

Now, let's dive into the code that will perform the presentation-to-PDF conversion with progress updates. Use the following source code:

```csharp
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation(dataDir + "ConvertToPDF.pptx"))
{
    ISaveOptions saveOptions = new PdfOptions();
    saveOptions.ProgressCallback = new ExportProgressHandler();
    presentation.Save(dataDir + "ConvertToPDF.pdf", SaveFormat.Pdf, saveOptions);
}
```

In this code snippet, we open the PowerPoint presentation using Aspose.Slides and specify the PDF format for saving. We also set the `ProgressCallback` property to an instance of the `ExportProgressHandler` class.

## Step 3: Implementing the Progress Callback

We now need to implement the `ExportProgressHandler` class to handle progress updates during the conversion process. Here's the code for the `ExportProgressHandler` class:

```csharp
class ExportProgressHandler : IProgressCallback
{
    public void Reporting(double progressValue)
    {
        // Use progress percentage value here
        int progress = Convert.ToInt32(progressValue);
        Console.WriteLine(progress + "% file converted");
    }
}
```

This class implements the `IProgressCallback` interface and defines the `Reporting` method to handle progress updates. It prints the current progress percentage to the console.

## Step 4: Running the Code

Compile and run your project. You will observe the progress updates in the console as the presentation is converted to PDF.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully created a step-by-step tutorial for converting a presentation to PDF with progress updates using Aspose.Slides for .NET. This skill can be invaluable in various scenarios, such as generating reports or archiving presentations.
