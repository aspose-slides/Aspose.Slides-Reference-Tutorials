# Create Responsive HTML from Presentation


Creating responsive HTML from a presentation using Aspose.Slides for .NET is a valuable skill for developers looking to convert PowerPoint presentations into web-friendly formats. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process step by step, using the provided source code.

## 1. Introduction

PowerPoint presentations are a popular way to convey information, but sometimes you need to make them accessible on the web. Aspose.Slides for .NET offers a convenient solution for converting presentations to responsive HTML. This allows you to share your content with a broader audience.

## 2. Getting Started with Aspose.Slides for .NET

Before we begin, make sure you have Aspose.Slides for .NET installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/net/). Once installed, you're ready to start.

## 3. Setting Up Your Environment

To get started, create a new project in your preferred development environment. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access your document and output directories.

## 4. Loading the Presentation

In your source code, you'll need to specify the location of your PowerPoint presentation. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path to your presentation file.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
string outPath = "Your Output Directory";

// Instantiate a Presentation object that represents a presentation file
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation(dataDir + "Convert_HTML.pptx"))
{
    // Your code here
}
```

## 5. Creating a Responsive HTML Controller

Next, create a `ResponsiveHtmlController` object. This controller will help you format the HTML output effectively.

## 6. Configuring HTML Options

Configure the HTML options by creating an `HtmlOptions` object. You can customize the HTML formatting as needed. For example, you can create a custom HTML formatter using the `HtmlFormatter.CreateCustomFormatter(controller)` method.

```csharp
ResponsiveHtmlController controller = new ResponsiveHtmlController();
HtmlOptions htmlOptions = new HtmlOptions { HtmlFormatter = HtmlFormatter.CreateCustomFormatter(controller) };
```

## 7. Saving the Presentation to HTML

Now, it's time to save the presentation as responsive HTML. Specify the output path as shown below:

```csharp
presentation.Save(outPath + "ConvertPresentationToResponsiveHTML_out.html", SaveFormat.Html, htmlOptions);
```
