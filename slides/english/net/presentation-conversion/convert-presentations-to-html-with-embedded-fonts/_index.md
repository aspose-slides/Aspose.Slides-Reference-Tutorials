In today's digital age, sharing presentations and documents online has become a common practice. However, one challenge that often arises is ensuring that your fonts are correctly displayed when converting presentations to HTML. This step-by-step tutorial will guide you through the process of using Aspose.Slides for .NET to convert presentations to HTML with embedded fonts, ensuring that your documents look just as you intended them to.

## Introduction to Aspose.Slides for .NET

Before we dive into the tutorial, let's briefly introduce Aspose.Slides for .NET. It is a powerful library that allows developers to work with PowerPoint presentations in .NET applications. With Aspose.Slides, you can create, modify, and convert PowerPoint files programmatically.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.Slides for .NET: You should have the Aspose.Slides library installed in your project. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/net/).

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

1. Create a new project or open an existing one in your preferred .NET development environment.

2. Add a reference to the Aspose.Slides library in your project.

3. Import the necessary namespaces in your code:

   ```csharp
   using Aspose.Slides;
   ```

## Step 2: Load Your Presentation

To begin, you need to load the presentation you want to convert to HTML. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual directory where your presentation file is located.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir + "presentation.pptx"))
{
    // Your code goes here
}
```

## Step 3: Exclude Default Presentation Fonts

In this step, you can specify any default presentation fonts that you want to exclude from embedding. This can help optimize the size of the resulting HTML file.

```csharp
string[] fontNameExcludeList = { };
```

## Step 4: Choose an HTML Controller

Now, you have two options for embedding fonts in the HTML:

### Option 1: Embed All Fonts

To embed all fonts used in the presentation, use the `EmbedAllFontsHtmlController`.

```csharp
EmbedAllFontsHtmlController embedFontsController = new EmbedAllFontsHtmlController(fontNameExcludeList);
```

### Option 2: Link All Fonts

To link to all fonts used in the presentation, use the `LinkAllFontsHtmlController`. You should specify the directory where the fonts are located on your system.

```csharp
LinkAllFontsHtmlController linkcont = new LinkAllFontsHtmlController(fontNameExcludeList, @"C:\Windows\Fonts\");
```

## Step 5: Define HTML Options

Create an `HtmlOptions` object and set the HTML formatter to the one you selected in the previous step.

```csharp
HtmlOptions htmlOptionsEmbed = new HtmlOptions
{
    HtmlFormatter = HtmlFormatter.CreateCustomFormatter(linkcont) // Use embedFontsController for embedding all fonts
};
```

## Step 6: Save as HTML

Finally, save the presentation as an HTML file. You can choose either `SaveFormat.Html` or `SaveFormat.Html5` depending on your requirements.

```csharp
pres.Save("pres.html", SaveFormat.Html, htmlOptionsEmbed);
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully converted your presentation to HTML with embedded fonts using Aspose.Slides for .NET. This ensures that your fonts will display correctly when sharing your presentations online.

Now, you can easily share your beautifully formatted presentations with confidence, knowing that your audience will see them exactly as you intended.
