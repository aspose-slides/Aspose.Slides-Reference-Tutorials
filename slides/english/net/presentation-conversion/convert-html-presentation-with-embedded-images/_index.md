# Convert HTML Presentation with Embedded Images


In today's digital world, the need to convert PowerPoint presentations to HTML is becoming increasingly important. Whether it's for sharing content online or creating web-based presentations, the ability to convert your PowerPoint files to HTML can be a valuable asset. Aspose.Slides for .NET is a powerful library that allows you to perform such conversions seamlessly. In this step-by-step guide, we will walk you through the process of converting an HTML presentation with embedded images using Aspose.Slides for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, you'll need to ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

### 1. Aspose.Slides for .NET

You must have Aspose.Slides for .NET installed. You can download the library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/net/).

### 2. A PowerPoint Presentation

Prepare the PowerPoint presentation that you want to convert to HTML. Make sure it contains embedded images.

### 3. .NET Development Environment

You should have a .NET development environment set up on your computer.

### 4. Basic Knowledge of C#

Familiarity with C# programming will be helpful in understanding and implementing the code.

## Importing Namespaces

Let's start by importing the necessary namespaces in your C# code. These namespaces are essential for working with Aspose.Slides for .NET.

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;
using Aspose.Slides.Export;
```

## Step 1: Set up Your Environment

Begin by creating a working directory for your project. This is where your PowerPoint presentation and HTML output files will be stored.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
string presentationName = Path.Combine(dataDir, "PresentationDemo.pptx");
string outFilePath = Path.Combine(dataDir, "HTMLConversion");
```

## Step 2: Load the PowerPoint Presentation

Now, load the PowerPoint presentation using Aspose.Slides.

```csharp
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation(presentationName))
{
    string outPath = dataDir;
}
```

## Step 3: Configure HTML Conversion Options

Next, configure the HTML conversion options. You can specify various settings, such as whether to embed images in the HTML or save them separately.

```csharp
Html5Options options = new Html5Options()
{
    // Force do not save images in HTML5 document
    EmbedImages = false,
    // Set the path for external images
    OutputPath = outPath
};
```

## Step 4: Create an Output Directory

Create a directory to store the output HTML document.

```csharp
if (!Directory.Exists(outFilePath))
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(outFilePath);
}
```

## Step 5: Save the Presentation as HTML

Finally, save the PowerPoint presentation as an HTML file using the configured options.

```csharp
pres.Save(Path.Combine(outFilePath, "pres.html"), SaveFormat.Html5, options);
```

Congratulations! You've successfully converted your PowerPoint presentation to an HTML file using Aspose.Slides for .NET. This can be incredibly useful for sharing your content online or creating web-based presentations.
