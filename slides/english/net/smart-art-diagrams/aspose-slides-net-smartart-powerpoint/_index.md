## Implementation Guide

### Adding SmartArt to a Slide

#### Overview
This section demonstrates how to add a dynamic SmartArt graphic to enhance your presentation’s visual appeal.

**Steps:**

##### 1. Initialize Presentation Object
Start by creating a new `Presentation` object.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation())
{
    // Access the first slide in the presentation.
    ISlide slide = presentation.Slides[0];
```

##### 2. Add SmartArt Shape
Add a SmartArt shape to your desired slide, specifying layout and position.

```csharp
    var chevron = slide.Shapes.AddSmartArt(10, 10, 800, 60, SmartArtLayoutType.ClosedChevronProcess);
```
- **Parameters:** 
  - `10, 10`: Position on the slide (X, Y coordinates)
  - `800x60`: Size of the shape
  - `ClosedChevronProcess`: Layout type for structured flow

##### 3. Customize Nodes
Add and customize nodes to display specific information.

```csharp
    var node = chevron.AllNodes.AddNode();
    node.TextFrame.Text = "Some text";
}
```

### Setting Node Fill Color

#### Overview
Customize the appearance of SmartArt nodes by changing their fill color.

**Steps:**

##### 1. Modify Fill Type and Color
Iterate through nodes to adjust visual properties.

```csharp
using System.Drawing;

foreach (var item in chevron.AllNodes[0].Shapes)
{
    // Change the fill type to solid and set the color to red.
    item.FillFormat.FillType = FillType.Solid;
    item.FillFormat.SolidFillColor.Color = Color.Red;
}
```
- **FillType**: Defines how the shape is filled
- **Color**: Specifies the color used

### Saving Presentation

#### Overview
Save your customized presentation to a specified location.

**Steps:**

##### 1. Define Output Directory and Save File

```csharp
string outputDir = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
presentation.Save(outputDir + "/FillFormat_SmartArt_ShapeNode_out.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
```
- **SaveFormat.Pptx**: Ensures the file is saved in PowerPoint format.
