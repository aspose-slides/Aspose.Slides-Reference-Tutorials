Are you looking to harness the power of Aspose.Slides for .NET to generate SVG files with custom shape IDs? You're in the right place! In this step-by-step tutorial, we'll guide you through the process using the following source code snippet. By the end, you'll be well-equipped to create SVG files with custom shape IDs in your presentations.

### Getting Started

Before we dive into the code, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.Slides for .NET: Make sure you have the Aspose.Slides library installed and ready to go.

2. Sample Presentation: You'll need a presentation file (e.g., "presentation.pptx") with shapes you want to export to SVG.

3. Output Directory: Define the directory where you want to save your SVG file (e.g., "Your Output Directory").

Now, let's break down the code step by step.

### Step 1: Setting Up the Environment

In this step, we'll initialize the necessary variables and load our presentation file.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
string outPath = "Your Output Directory";

using (Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir + "presentation.pptx"))
{
    // Your code goes here
}
```

Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your presentation file.

### Step 2: Writing Shapes as SVG

In this section, we'll write the shapes from the presentation as SVG files. We'll also specify a custom shape formatting controller for more control over the SVG output.

```csharp
using (FileStream stream = new FileStream(dataDir + "pptxFileName.svg", FileMode.OpenOrCreate))
{
    SVGOptions svgOptions = new SVGOptions
    {
        ShapeFormattingController = new CustomSvgShapeFormattingController()
    };

    pres.Slides[0].WriteAsSvg(stream, svgOptions);
}
```

Ensure you replace `"pptxFileName.svg"` with your desired output file name.

### Conclusion

And there you have it! You've successfully generated SVG files with custom shape IDs using Aspose.Slides for .NET. This powerful feature allows you to customize your SVG output to meet your specific needs.
