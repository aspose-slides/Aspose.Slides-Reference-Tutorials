using (Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir + "ConvertToPDF.pptx"))
{
    PdfOptions pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();

    // Set Jpeg Quality
    pdfOptions.JpegQuality = 90;

    // Define behavior for metafiles
    pdfOptions.SaveMetafilesAsPng = true;

    // Set Text Compression level
    pdfOptions.TextCompression = PdfTextCompression.Flate;

    // Define the PDF standard
    pdfOptions.Compliance = PdfCompliance.Pdf15;

    INotesCommentsLayoutingOptions options = pdfOptions.NotesCommentsLayouting;
    options.NotesPosition = NotesPositions.BottomFull;

    // Save the presentation to PDF with specified options
    pres.Save(outPath + "Custom_Option_Pdf_Conversion_out.pdf", SaveFormat.Pdf, pdfOptions);
}
```

## Step 4: Run the Conversion
