# Achieving PDF/A and PDF/UA Conformance with Aspose.Slides


## Introduction

In the world of digital documents, ensuring compatibility and accessibility is of paramount importance. PDF/A and PDF/UA are two standards that address these concerns. PDF/A focuses on archiving, while PDF/UA emphasizes accessibility for users with disabilities. Aspose.Slides for .NET offers an efficient way to achieve both PDF/A and PDF/UA conformance, making your presentations universally usable.

## Understanding PDF/A and PDF/UA

PDF/A is an ISO-standardized version of the Portable Document Format (PDF) specialized for digital preservation. It ensures that the content of the document remains intact over time, making it ideal for archiving purposes.

PDF/UA, on the other hand, stands for "PDF/Universal Accessibility." It's an ISO standard for creating universally accessible PDFs that can be read and navigated by people with disabilities using assistive technologies.
