In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of exporting media files to HTML from a presentation using Aspose.Slides for .NET. Aspose.Slides is a powerful API that allows you to work with PowerPoint presentations programmatically. By the end of this guide, you'll be able to convert your presentations into HTML format with ease. So, let's get started!

## 1. Introduction

PowerPoint presentations often contain multimedia elements such as videos, and you may need to export these presentations to HTML format for web compatibility. Aspose.Slides for .NET provides a convenient way to accomplish this task programmatically.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.Slides for .NET: You should have the Aspose.Slides for .NET library installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/net/).

## 3. Loading a Presentation

To start, you need to load the PowerPoint presentation you want to convert to HTML. You'll also need to specify the output directory where the HTML file will be saved. Here's the code for loading a presentation:

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
string outPath = "Your Output Directory";

// Loading a presentation
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation(dataDir + "example.pptx"))
{
    // Your code here
}
```

## 4. Setting Up HTML Options

Now, let's set up the HTML options for the conversion. We'll configure an HTML controller, HTML formatter, and slide image format. This code will ensure that your HTML file contains the necessary components for displaying multimedia elements.

```csharp
const string fileName = "video.html";
const string baseUri = "http://www.example.com/";

VideoPlayerHtmlController controller = new VideoPlayerHtmlController(path: path, fileName: fileName, baseUri: baseUri);

// Setting HTML options
HtmlOptions htmlOptions = new HtmlOptions(controller);
SVGOptions svgOptions = new SVGOptions(controller);

htmlOptions.HtmlFormatter = HtmlFormatter.CreateCustomFormatter(controller);
htmlOptions.SlideImageFormat = SlideImageFormat.Svg(svgOptions);
```

## 5. Saving the HTML File

With the HTML options configured, you can now save the HTML file. The `Save` method of the presentation object will generate the HTML file with embedded multimedia elements.

```csharp
// Saving the file
pres.Save(outPath + fileName, SaveFormat.Html, htmlOptions);
```

Congratulations! You've successfully exported media files to HTML from a PowerPoint presentation using Aspose.Slides for .NET. This allows you to share your presentations online with ease and ensure that multimedia elements are properly displayed.
