# Convert Presentation to TIFF with Custom Image Format


## Convert Presentation to TIFF with Custom Image Format using Aspose.Slides for .NET

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of converting a presentation to TIFF format using a custom image format. We will use Aspose.Slides for .NET, a powerful library for working with PowerPoint files in .NET applications. The custom image format allows you to specify advanced options for image conversion.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Visual Studio or any other .NET development environment.
2. Aspose.Slides for .NET library. You can download it from [here](https://downloads.aspose.com/slides/net).

## Steps

Follow these steps to convert a presentation to TIFF format with a custom image format:

## 1. Create a new C# Project

Start by creating a new C# project in your preferred .NET development environment.

## 2. Add Reference to Aspose.Slides

Add a reference to the Aspose.Slides for .NET library in your project. You can do this by right-clicking on the "References" section of your project in Solution Explorer and selecting "Add Reference." Browse and select the Aspose.Slides DLL you downloaded.

## 3. Write the Conversion Code

Open your project's main code file (e.g., `Program.cs`) and add the following using statement:

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;
using Aspose.Slides.Export;
```

Now, you can write the conversion code. Below is an example of how to convert a presentation to TIFF with a custom image format:

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Load the presentation
        using (Presentation presentation = new Presentation("input.pptx"))
        {
            // Initialize TIFF options with custom settings
            TiffOptions tiffOptions = new TiffOptions();
            tiffOptions.PixelFormat = ImagePixelFormat.Format8bppIndexed;

            // Save the presentation as TIFF using the custom options
            presentation.Save("output.tiff", SaveFormat.Tiff, tiffOptions);
        }
    }
}
```

Replace `"input.pptx"` with the path to your input PowerPoint presentation and adjust the settings in `TiffOptions` as needed. In this example, we set the compression type to LZW and the pixel format to 16-bit RGB 555.

## 4. Run the Application

Build and run your application. It will load the input presentation, convert it to TIFF with the specified custom image format settings, and save the output as "output.tiff" in the same directory as your application.

## Conclusion

In this guide, you learned how to convert a presentation to TIFF format with a custom image format using Aspose.Slides for .NET. You can further explore the library's documentation to discover more advanced features and customization options.
