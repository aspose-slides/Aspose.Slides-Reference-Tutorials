Are you looking to enhance your presentations with eye-catching SVG shapes? Aspose.Slides for .NET can be your ultimate tool for achieving this. In this comprehensive tutorial, we will walk you through the process of formatting SVG shapes in presentations using Aspose.Slides for .NET. Follow along with the provided source code and transform your presentations into visually appealing masterpieces.

## Introduction

In today's digital age, presentations play a crucial role in conveying information effectively. Incorporating Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) shapes can make your presentations more engaging and visually stunning. With Aspose.Slides for .NET, you can effortlessly format SVG shapes to meet your specific design requirements.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.Slides for .NET installed in your development environment.
- A working knowledge of C# programming.
- A sample PowerPoint presentation file that you want to enhance with SVG shapes.

## Getting Started

Let's start by setting up our project and understanding the source code provided.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
string outPath = "Your Output Directory";
string pptxFileName = Path.Combine(dataDir, "Convert_Svg_Custom.pptx");
string outSvgFileName = Path.Combine(outPath, "Convert_Svg_Custom.svg");

using (Presentation pres = new Presentation(pptxFileName))
{
    using (FileStream stream = new FileStream(outSvgFileName, FileMode.Create))
    {
        SVGOptions svgOptions = new SVGOptions
        {
            ShapeFormattingController = new MySvgShapeFormattingController()
        };

        pres.Slides[0].WriteAsSvg(stream, svgOptions);
    }
}
```

This code snippet initializes the necessary directories and file paths, opens a PowerPoint presentation, and converts it to an SVG file while applying formatting using the `MySvgShapeFormattingController`.

## Understanding the SVG Shape Formatting Controller

Let's take a closer look at the `MySvgShapeFormattingController` class:

```csharp
class MySvgShapeFormattingController : ISvgShapeAndTextFormattingController
{
    private int m_shapeIndex, m_portionIndex, m_tspanIndex;

    public MySvgShapeFormattingController(int shapeStartIndex = 0)
    {
        m_shapeIndex = shapeStartIndex;
        m_portionIndex = 0;
    }

    public void FormatShape(Aspose.Slides.Export.ISvgShape svgShape, IShape shape)
    {
        svgShape.Id = string.Format("shape-{0}", m_shapeIndex++);
        m_portionIndex = m_tspanIndex = 0;
    }

    // More formatting methods go here...

    public ISvgShapeFormattingController AsISvgShapeFormattingController
    {
        get { return this; }
    }
}
```

This controller class handles the formatting of both shapes and text within the SVG output. It assigns unique IDs to shapes and text spans, ensuring proper rendering.

## Conclusion

You've learned how to set up your project, apply the `MySvgShapeFormattingController` for precise formatting, and convert your presentation to an SVG file. By following these steps, you can create captivating presentations that leave a lasting impression on your audience.
