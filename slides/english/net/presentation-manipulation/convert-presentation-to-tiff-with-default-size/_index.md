## Introduction

Aspose.Slides for .NET is a robust library that provides comprehensive functionalities for creating, modifying, and converting PowerPoint presentations programmatically. One of its remarkable features is the ability to convert presentations to various image formats, including TIFF.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the coding process, you need to ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Visual Studio or any other .NET development environment
- Aspose.Slides for .NET library (Download from [here](https://downloads.aspose.com/slides/net)
- Basic knowledge of C# programming

## Installing Aspose.Slides for .NET

To get started, follow these steps to install the Aspose.Slides for .NET library:

1. Download the Aspose.Slides for .NET library from [here](https://downloads.aspose.com/slides/net).
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a suitable location on your system.

## Loading the Presentation

Once you have the Aspose.Slides library integrated into your project, you can start coding. Begin by loading the presentation file you want to convert to TIFF. Here's an example of how to do it:

using var presentation = new Presentation("your-presentation.pptx");
```

## Converting to TIFF with Default Size

After loading the presentation, the next step is to convert it to a TIFF image format while maintaining the default size. This ensures that the content's layout and design are preserved. Here's how you can achieve this:

```csharp
// Convert to TIFF with default size
var options = new TiffOptions()
{
    CompressionType = TiffCompressionTypes.Default;
};
presentation.Save("output.tiff", SaveFormat.Tiff, options);
```

## Saving the TIFF Image

Finally, save the generated TIFF image to the desired location using the `Save` method:

```csharp
// Save the TIFF image
presentation.Save("output.tiff", SaveFormat.Tiff,options);
```
