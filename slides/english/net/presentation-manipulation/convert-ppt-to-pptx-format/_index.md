If you've ever needed to convert PowerPoint files from the older PPT format to the newer PPTX format using .NET, you're in the right place. In this step-by-step tutorial, we will walk you through the process using the Aspose.Slides for .NET API. With this powerful library, you can effortlessly handle such conversions with ease. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, make sure you have the following set up:

- Visual Studio: Ensure that you have Visual Studio installed and ready for .NET development.
- Aspose.Slides for .NET: Download and install the Aspose.Slides for .NET library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/slides/net/).

## Setting Up the Project

1. Create a New Project: Open Visual Studio and create a new C# project.

2. Add Reference to Aspose.Slides: Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer, choose "Manage NuGet Packages," and search for "Aspose.Slides." Install the package.

3. Import Required Namespaces:

```csharp
using Aspose.Slides;
```

## Converting PPT to PPTX

Now that we have our project set up, let's write the code to convert a PPT file to PPTX.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
string outPath = "Your Output Directory";

string srcFileName = dataDir + "Conversion PPT to PPTX.ppt";
string destFileName = dataDir + "Conversion PPT to PPTX.pptx";

// Instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPT file
Presentation pres = new Presentation(srcFileName);

// Saving the presentation in PPTX format
pres.Save(outPath, SaveFormat.Pptx);
```

In this code snippet:

- `dataDir` should be replaced with the directory path where your PPT file is located.
- `outPath` should be replaced with the directory where you want to save the converted PPTX file.
- `srcFileName` is the name of your input PPT file.
- `destFileName` is the desired name for the output PPTX file.
