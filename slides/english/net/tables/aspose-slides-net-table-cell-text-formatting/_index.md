### Implementation Guide

#### Setting Font Height in Table Cells

Customizing the font height can make certain data stand out. Here’s how you can set it:

**Overview:**
This feature lets you adjust the font size within table cells, enhancing readability and visual appeal.

1. **Initialize Presentation Object**
   
   ```csharp
   string dataDir = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
   Presentation presentation = new Presentation(dataDir + "pres.pptx");
   ```

2. **Access Slide and Table**
   
   ```csharp
   ISlide slide = presentation.Slides[0];
   ITable someTable = (ITable)slide.Shapes[0];
   ```

3. **Set Font Height**
   
   Create a `PortionFormat` object to define font properties:
   
   ```csharp
   PortionFormat portionFormat = new PortionFormat { FontHeight = 25 };
   someTable.SetTextFormat(portionFormat);
   ```

4. **Save the Presentation**
   
   ```csharp
   presentation.Save(dataDir + "result_font_height.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
   ```

#### Aligning Text and Setting Right Margin in Table Cells

Aligning text and defining margins are essential for structured presentations.

**Overview:**
This feature allows you to align text to the right and set a specific right margin within table cells.

1. **Initialize Presentation Object**
   
   ```csharp
   Presentation presentation = new Presentation(dataDir + "pres.pptx");
   ```

2. **Access Slide and Table**
   
   ```csharp
   ISlide slide = presentation.Slides[0];
   ITable someTable = (ITable)slide.Shapes[0];
   ```

3. **Set Text Alignment and Margin**
   
   Use a `ParagraphFormat` object:
   
   ```csharp
   ParagraphFormat paragraphFormat = new ParagraphFormat { 
       Alignment = TextAlignment.Right, 
       MarginRight = 20 
   };
   someTable.SetTextFormat(paragraphFormat);
   ```

4. **Save the Presentation**
   
   ```csharp
   presentation.Save(dataDir + "result_text_alignment.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
   ```

#### Setting Vertical Text Type in Table Cells

Vertical text orientation can add a unique flair to your presentations.

**Overview:**
This feature allows you to set vertical text orientation within table cells, useful for creative or language-specific layouts.

1. **Initialize Presentation Object**
   
   ```csharp
   Presentation presentation = new Presentation(dataDir + "pres.pptx");
   ```

2. **Access Slide and Table**
   
   ```csharp
   ISlide slide = presentation.Slides[0];
   ITable someTable = (ITable)slide.Shapes[0];
   ```

3. **Set Vertical Text Orientation**
   
   Create a `TextFrameFormat` object:
   
   ```csharp
   TextFrameFormat textFrameFormat = new TextFrameFormat { 
       TextVerticalType = TextVerticalType.Vertical 
   };
   someTable.SetTextFormat(textFrameFormat);
   ```

4. **Save the Presentation**
   
   ```csharp
   presentation.Save(dataDir + "result_vertical_text.pptx", SaveFormat.Pptx);
   ```

### Practical Applications
