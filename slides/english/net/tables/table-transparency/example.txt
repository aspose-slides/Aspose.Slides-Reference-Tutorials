//ExSummary:This code demonstrates how to modify the transparency of a table in a PowerPoint presentation. The example shows loading an existing presentation, accessing a specific table, adjusting its transparency value, and saving the modified presentation.
//ExStepSummary:0:The following code shows how to define file paths for input and output presentations:
//ExStepSummary:1:The following code shows how to load an existing presentation:
//ExStepSummary:2:The following code shows how to access a table in the first slide:
//ExStepSummary:3:The following code shows how to set the transparency value for the table:
//ExStepSummary:4:The following code shows how to save the modified presentation:

//ExStepImage:3:images/2.png

//ExStep:0-
// Define the path to the input presentation file
string presentationFilePath = RunExamples.GetDataDir_Tables() + "TableTransparency.pptx";

// Define the path for the output presentation file
string outFilePath = Path.Combine(RunExamples.OutPath, "TableTransparency_out.pptx");

//ExStep:1-
// Create a new presentation object by loading the existing presentation
using (Presentation pres = new Presentation(presentationFilePath))
{
//ExStep:2-
    // Access the table object from the first slide (index 0)
    // The table is the second shape (index 1) on the slide
    ITable table = (ITable)pres.Slides[0].Shapes[1];
    
//ExStep:3-
    // Set the transparency of the table to 62%
    // Transparency value ranges from 0.0 (fully opaque) to 1.0 (fully transparent)
    table.TableFormat.Transparency = 0.62f; 
    
//ExStep:4-
    // Save the modified presentation to the output file in PPTX format
    pres.Save(outFilePath, SaveFormat.Pptx);
}
